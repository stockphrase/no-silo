      <description>Open Handbook  Preface College students are commonly required to purchase handbooks for use in their writing courses. These reference texts introduce students to the conventions of academic writing and often include chapters on academic research, critical thinking, grammar, and formal citation.
The knowledge contained in these texts is indispensable. However, most handbooks on the market today are bloated in both content and price (I think the former is often the justification for the latter).</description>

      <description>Essay Three: Theoretical Analysis  Max Fischer has an insatiable appetite for extracurricular activities: fencing, bee-keeping, yankee racers, calligraphy, backgammon, theater, and on and on and on. These projects and clubs are forms of self-improvement&amp;mdash;kinds of sovereign inquiry&amp;mdash;but they completely dwarf his responsibilities in the traditional disciplines of formal education: geometry, history, English, etc. According to Dr. Guggenheim, Max is &amp;ldquo;one of the worst students&amp;rdquo; at Rushmore Academy.</description>

      <description>Essay Two: Synthesis  Percy and Freire, each in their own way, ask us to consider the problem of authority within educational systems or experiences. Write an essay that synthesizes their thinking, explaining how they both investigate the nature of this problem, examine its consequences, and offer solutions.
As the name suggests, synthesis essays focus on combining and connecting. Your focus in a synthesis essay is to explain to your audience the ways in which two or more arguments or ideas relate to one another.</description>

      <description>---    Post-apocalyptic Fiction, Film, and Art Course Description Why do we feel such an attraction to disaster? Why do we produce novels, films, and other forms of art that contemplate the end of humanity? Scholars from many disciplines have offered theories about the appeal and meaning of such spectacles of apocalyptic destruction. We will read some of this critical literature, examining views from disciplines such as psychology, sociology, cultural studies, and religion.</description>

      <description>Open Handbook  Chapter One: Annotation and Critical Reading   There is something predatory, cruel even, about a pen suspended over a text. Like a hawk over a field, it is on the lookout for something vulnerable. Then it is a pleasure to swoop and skewer the victim with the nib&amp;rsquo;s sharp point. The mere fact of holding the hand poised for action changes our attitude to the text.</description>

      <description>Observations on the Post-Apocalyptic A collection of random thoughts on the post-apocalyptic narrative:
 The post-apocalyptic narrative is a fantasy or species of wish-fulfillment that expresses a desire for the end of civilization as we know it. The popularity of such films suggest a range of audience responses and psychological conditions behind this wish:    1a. Economic despair and disempowering socio-economic structuring lead to a fanciful embrace of post-apocalyptic narrative as a balm, compensation, a comfort.</description>

      <description>Week One Disaster, Apocalypse, and the State of Nature
Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan (1651)  Men are essentially equal when all is “reckoned together.” Equal in power, equal in common sense or wisdom. We might think that we are smarter than others, but we are mostly the same.  This sense of equality leads to three causes of &amp;ldquo;quarrel&amp;rdquo;:
  COMPETITION: Because we know ourselves to be equals, we become hopeful of attaining ends, goals, possessions.</description>

There was almost complete silence. The movie had stopped being delightfully scary about halfway through, and had become unexpectedly terrifying. There was a little girl across the aisle from me, maybe nine years old, who was sitting very still in her seat and crying.</description>

      <description>Open Handbook  Chapter Two: Critical Notes   We believe the best way to work on a difficult text is by rereading . . . but you can also work on the difficult text by writing, by taking possession of the work through sentences and paragraphs of your own, through summary, paraphrase, and quotation, by making another writer&amp;rsquo;s work part of your work (12).

      <description>Open Handbook  Audience   [A] work of rhetoric is pragmatic; it comes into existence for the sake of something beyond itself; it functions ultimately to produce action or change in the world; it performs some task. In short, rhetoric is a mode of altering reality, not by the direct application of energy to objects, but by the creation of discourse which changes reality through the mediation of thought and action.</description>

      <description>Open Handbook  Chapter Four: The Joy of Reuse  Save all your work Most students complete their school work, turn it in to their professor, then never think of it again. These efforts then cross the event horizon into the black hole of a computer hard drive, never to emerge again. If this sounds like your standard practice, consider a change now that you&amp;rsquo;ve arrived at college. When you write something (essays, notes, reports, projects, code), or when you use something (course readings, research, data), keep a copy of it in some organized folder system so you may return to it in the future.</description>

      <description>Open Handbook  What is Good Writing?  Academic writing takes many forms. However, all good academic writing shares several basic characteristics:
  Good academic writing always contains a strong thesis statement&amp;mdash;an idea, stated as an assertion, that is the work&amp;rsquo;s central focus.
  Good academic writing is organized: each paragraph builds upon the one before it, creating a strong sense of purpose. The paragraphs themselves are unified, generally pursuing a single idea that helps support the thesis.</description>

      <description>Open Handbook  Types of College Writing  Most students are trained in high school to write what is known as a five-paragraph essay&amp;mdash;a form of writing containing an introduction, three paragraphs of support, and a summary conclusion. In that it encourages students to think about introductions, structure, organization, paragraphing, evidence, and reasoning, the five-paragraph essay is good training for novice writers. However, this particular rhetorical form is extremely limiting: only certain, rather paltry, thoughts and ideas may be placed within a five paragraph structure.</description>

The words themselves were mostly foreign, but I still remember the exact moment when I first understood, with a sudden clarity, the purpose of a paragraph. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the vocabulary to say &amp;quot;paragraph,&amp;quot; but I realized that a paragraph was a fence that held words. The words inside a paragraph worked together for a common purpose.</description>

&amp;ndash;Cormac McCarthy
  Academic writing always involves integrating the thinking of others into your own writing. There are only three ways that the words and ideas of others may appear in your writing: summary, paraphrase, and quotation. Writing an academic paper requires a mastery of all three skills. It is critical to always give credit to the other authors whose ideas or words you borrow.</description>

      <description>Open Handbook  Altering Sources  In your life as a writer you will frequently encounter situations where you must alter a source quotation in some way. Generally, these alterations are used to satisfy grammar or make your writing easier to follow by removing or adding words or phrases.
  To indicate that we have removed words from a source text we use ellipses . . . a series of periods to mark where something has been removed from the source.</description>

 This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring.</description>

      <description>Open Handbook  Documentation of Sources  Accurately documenting sources is a vital aspect of any process of inquiry. If you fail to properly document your sources, your readers will be unable to follow your research, validate your claims, or judge the quality of your argument. Furthermore, failing to properly cite a source (whether summarized, paraphrased, or quoted) opens you to the charge of plagiarism, a serious academic offense.</description>

      <description>Open Handbook  Common Sentence Errors  A statistical study of student writing performed in 1988 by scholars Andrea Lunsford and Robert Connors demonstrated that virtually 100% student writing mistakes are limited to 20 formal errors. Eliminating these errors in your writing therefore offers the quickest path to error-free prose.

      <description>WR2 | Workshops  Altering sources  Integrating quotations from other sources is an important part of academic writing. However, doing so is rarely a simple process of cutting and pasting the words from a source into your own document. Instead, you will routinely encounter challenges during the quotation of a source that threaten the clarity and correctness of your prose. For example:
   What do you do when you are writing in the present tense and the source material you are quoting uses the past tense?</description>

      <description>WR2 | Workshops  Annotation  In college you will encounter demanding texts of great complexity. You will be asked to engage these texts critically and to challenge the thinking and conclusions of others. You will also have to retain an extraordinary amount of information and recall it later. To thrive in this environment you will need to develop some new habits and strategies. The most basic, and most fundamental, of these is a formal procedure for the annotation of texts.</description>

      <description>WR2 | Workshops  Argument Analysis  Analysis involves breaking an argument down into smaller parts so that you can understand how those parts work together to make the whole (or fail to do so). During this class we will try to train our minds to uncover the argumentative structure of all that we read.

      <description>WR2 | Workshops  Argument Summary  In a summary you present the ideas of another writer in condensed form. The length of a summary is dictated by your rhetorical needs, but they are always shorter than the original text. For example, the summary of a large book could be 20 pages, one paragraph, or one sentence. Although a summary sacrifices specificity and detail in the interest of brevity, it must always remain a faithful representation of the original text&amp;rsquo;s meaning.</description>

      <description>Argument Synthesis  What is synthesis? As the name suggests, synthesis involves combining and connecting. Your focus in a synthesis essay is to explain to your audience the ways in which two or more arguments relate to each another.
Students attempting synthesis for the first time often make the mistake of organizing their essays by source. For example, they will introduce two authors in their introduction, summarize Author A for a few paragraphs, summarize Author B for a few paragraphs, then conclude the essay by noting the broad similarities and differences in the two authors’ thinking.</description>

Don&amp;rsquo;t be silly; of course not.

Examining periodicals&amp;mdash;especially academic journals&amp;mdash;is an important aspect of research.

      <description>WR3 | Workshops  Introduction to Academic Research  &amp;ldquo;The problem is that doing scholarly work is intrinsically a mess.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;mdash; Kieran Healy
 Perhaps the most common feature of books designed to help students do academic research is their dishonesty. These textbooks present academic research as an orderly list of procedures and tasks, each one leading logically to the next, culminating in a superbly crafted essay. This narrative generally begins with the formulation of a research question, proceeds to the gathering of background information and secondary sources, and finally to the drafting, revision, and completion of the project.</description>

      <description>WR3 | Workshops  Peer review Peer review is a form of quality control in academic publishing. Before books or articles are published, they experience a rigorous process of evaluation by at least three experts who have advanced training in the field of study in question. These &amp;ldquo;referees,&amp;rdquo; as they are known, review the work anonymously. This anonymity theoretically ensures a more honest appraisal of the work under consideration for publication.</description>
