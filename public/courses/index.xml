      <description>Essay Three: Theoretical Analysis  Max Fischer has an insatiable appetite for extracurricular activities: fencing, bee-keeping, yankee racers, calligraphy, backgammon, theater, and on and on and on. These projects and clubs are forms of self-improvement&amp;mdash;kinds of sovereign inquiry&amp;mdash;but they completely dwarf his responsibilities in the traditional disciplines of formal education: geometry, history, English, etc. According to Dr. Guggenheim, Max is &amp;ldquo;one of the worst students&amp;rdquo; at Rushmore Academy.</description>

      <description>Essay Two: Synthesis  Percy and Freire, each in their own way, ask us to consider the problem of authority within educational systems or experiences. Write an essay that synthesizes their thinking, explaining how they both investigate the nature of this problem, examine its consequences, and offer solutions.
As the name suggests, synthesis essays focus on combining and connecting. Your focus in a synthesis essay is to explain to your audience the ways in which two or more arguments or ideas relate to one another.</description>

      <description>Observations on the Post-Apocalyptic A collection of random thoughts on the post-apocalyptic narrative:

The popularity of such films suggest a range of audience responses and psychological conditions behind this wish:    1a. Economic despair and disempowering socio-economic structuring lead to a fanciful embrace of post-apocalyptic narrative as a balm, compensation, a comfort.</description>

      <description>Week One Disaster, Apocalypse, and the State of Nature
Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan (1651)  Men are essentially equal when all is “reckoned together.” Equal in power, equal in common sense or wisdom. We might think that we are smarter than others, but we are mostly the same.  This sense of equality leads to three causes of &amp;ldquo;quarrel&amp;rdquo;:
  COMPETITION: Because we know ourselves to be equals, we become hopeful of attaining ends, goals, possessions.</description>

      <description>Stills from Night of the Living Dead (1968)  Review of Night of the Living Dead by film critic Roger Ebert (1969):   &amp;ldquo;The kids in the audience were stunned.
