<p><code>Disaster, Apocalypse, and the State of Nature</code></p>
<h2 id="thomas-hobbes-leviathan-1651">Thomas Hobbes, <em>Leviathan</em> (1651)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Men are essentially equal when all is “reckoned together.” Equal in power, equal in common sense or wisdom. We might think that we are smarter than others, but we are mostly the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>This sense of equality leads to three causes of &ldquo;quarrel&rdquo;:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>COMPETITION</code>: Because we know ourselves to be equals, we become hopeful of attaining ends, goals, possessions. However, this puts us at odds with others; when two people want the same thing, they become enemies. As a result, they attempt to “subdue” or “destroy” each other. Sometimes this is just for self-preservation; sometimes it is just out of pleasure. Thus, if you grow crops, or have a house, or money, and you are alone, without protection, someone will come and take it from you. And this invader is likewise vulnerable to someone else&ndash;perhaps someone bigger, stronger, or perhaps a bunch of people who might come to kill you and take your stuff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>DIFFIDENCE</code>: We desire security, the “conservation” of our lives and what we need to live. This is living within the “modest bounds” of human life. In this case, we “master” only those who seek to take our lives or the things we need to live. However, there are others who are not so modest, who desire power, control over others, dominance, “conquest.” Therefore, this compels even the “modest” person to engage in the conquest of others; merely trying to defend oneself is a losing proposition. The logic of this situation demands that I take what other’s have before they take everything from me.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>GLORY</code>: Without an authority that keeps humans in “awe” with it’s power, we seek to elevate ourselves over each other for reputation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Key summary about Hobbes’ view on the <em>nature</em> of mankind</strong>: “So
that in the nature of man, we find three principles of quarrel.
First, competition; secondly, diffidence; thirdly, glory. The first
maketh men invade for gain; the second, for safety; and the third,
for reputation. The first use violence, to make themselves masters
of other men’s persons, wives, children, and cattle; the second, to
defend them; the third, for trifles, as a word, a smile, a different
opinion, and any other sign of undervalue, either direct in their
persons or by reflection in their kindred, their friends, their
nation, their profession, their name”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>War is a “tract of time”</strong>: War isn’t just moments of battle; war
is “a tract of time, wherein the will to contend by battle is
sufficiently known.” By this, I believe, Hobbes means that when we
all know we are experiencing a time of war, that knowledge has
consequences and introduces a new dynamic to our thinking. For example, when I
encounter a stranger, the logic of war demands that I kill first and
ask questions later: <em>I know that you know; you know that I know;
and I know that you know that I know that this is war</em>. When we find
ourselves in this situation, the most logical reaction is to kill
everyone you encounter and take all that you see because everyone
else will do the same. And even if they wouldn’t, we must act as if
they would. Thus, even a reasonable and nonviolent person is
forced into a stance of violence. And this has further consequences. Our behavior doesn&rsquo;t just
change when we are engaged in battles. This war is like weather, a &ldquo;tract of time&rdquo; when
a battle may occur at any moment unexpectedly. Thus, when we know we are in this time of war,
there is no: 1) economy, 2) no planting or harvesting of food, 3) no
transportation of goods, 4) no exploration, 5) no arts, or books, or
culture. What exists is “continual fear, and danger of violent
death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and
short.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The State of Nature is amoral</strong>: there is no good or evil, no
notion of right or wrong, there is just a basic, violent, struggle
of survival. There is no “mine” and &ldquo;thine,&rdquo; no property: just
what we have as long as we can keep it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="curtis-post-apocalyptic-fiction-and-the-social-contract">Curtis, <em>Post-Apocalyptic Fiction and the Social Contract</em></h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The book is about <strong>social contract theory</strong>, the <strong>state of
nature</strong>, and postapocalyptic fiction. <em>The main thesis is that this
fiction is about our desire to “start over”</em> (2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This fiction describes a surviving remnant of humanity within the
blank slate of the <em>state of nature</em>. As such, it foregrounds human
motivations, human nature, the different ways that we “seek to live
together” and the conflict between those two visions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This fiction imaginatively considers the “conditions under which we
would like to live” (2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Curtis notes that this form of fiction has completely “suffused the
popular culture” (3). I wonder: what does that say about our views
on the civilization we’ve built?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Curtis argues that Social Contract Theory is always “backward”
looking: it attempts to justify the present civilization and state
of affairs. In that sense, it is a conservative exercise or theory.
However, postapocalyptic fiction is “forward looking” in that it
imagines what <em>could</em> be. Thus, it is potentially “utopian” in nature.
While Curtis doesn’t say this, we might just say that it is a
revolutionary act.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>​(4) Social Contract Theory is dry; Post-apocalyptic fiction
dramatizes the theory, helps us imagine it, makes it more powerful.
The Post-apocalyptic fiction is <em>cathartic</em>, in that by seeing the
fictional destruction we are purged of our fears or “awakened” to
the need to prevent it. Post-apocalyptic fiction provides a “useful
fiction” that we may use to “come together and renegotiate our
lives”: How do we want to live? (6).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Great quote here about the multiple purposes of Post-apocalyptic fiction</strong>. It destroys all systems of order. All hierarchies, all
laws and systems, all constraints about sexuality and gender, and
morality. We can built the world again. They provide an opportunity
to examine our civilization, our nations, our cultures and evaluate
them. Again, this is a radical, revolutionary act to imagine the
destruction of the current order (6-7).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are dystopian fictions where there is no starting over (like
in <em>The Road</em>), and utopian fictions where we start over again (7)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PAF allows us to ask: “what do we fear, what do we desire, how do we
plan to allay those fears and realize those desires”? (7).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Narrative structure of PAF</strong>: 1) White man is the hero —&gt;
DESTRUCTION —&gt; He finds a companion —&gt; They encounter “the other”
—&gt; THREAT —&gt; Form larger community —&gt; Connect with other
communities —&gt; Defeat Others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(10). <strong>Purpose of State of Nature theory is to argue against the
idea that government is natural (like divine right of kings)</strong>.
Instead, it is a construct, something made by mankind. Thus, it can
be revised, altered. Allows us to imagine what kind of world or
government we would want to have in place of the existing one. PAF
makes that much more dramatic and personal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>She mentions John Rawls’ idea of the “Original Position” from his
<em>Theory of Justice</em> (1973).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mathias-nilges-the-aesthetics-of-destruction">Mathias Nilges, “The Aesthetics of Destruction”</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Representations of destruction are narratives, stories that cultures
attempt to explain “the relationship between our existence and the
external world” (23).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>particular form that the destruction takes</em> is historically
determined; thus we need to study that particular history if we are
to understand the form it gave rise to (and understand why we find
it appealing or beautiful).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Important quote</strong>: “The first step in such an analysis is to
suggest that representations of destruction grow in number and
popularity especially in times of (national) political, moral, and
psychological uncertainty. Thus, we must analyze the beauty of such
representations in relation to the specific fears, anxieties, and
desires a historical period produces—psychological reactions that
directly affect cultural form and our understanding of beauty” (23).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Thesis Questions</strong>: Nilges argues that there has been a large
increase in the production of “(post)apocalyptic” narrative. If we
examine them in the historical context of the War on Terror, what
can we learn? What do these narratives reveal about our
psychological condition?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He argues that these representations of destruction are &ldquo;a
popular way of working through or at least highlighting
psychological contradictions produced by moments of severe crisis&rdquo;
(24). For example, we feared nuclear destruction or “body snatchers”
during the Cold War. But now, in the post-9/11 world we see a return
of the destruction narrative that focuses on things like terrorism. I’m
thinking about shows like <em>24</em>, <em>Homeland</em>, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Solutions to problems and anxiety</strong>: Examining the beauty in these
depictions of destruction helps us move beyond a mere description of
our fears; it helps us analyze and understand “how these fears are
being resolved ideologically, sociopolitically and, ultimately,
culturally” (24). These representations of destruction function
“primarily as a solution to the problems posed by a complex and
anxiety-inducing present”(24).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Destruction is now viewed as antidote</strong>: Nilges argues that,
unlike the Cold war films, when the fear was the nuclear bombs would
<em>destroy a world we loved</em>, today we find the destruction beautiful
because we see it as “an antidote to the world that produces the
fears we seek to escape” (24). <strong>Translation</strong>: our views of what
is beautiful are historically contingent&mdash;they change over time and
are unique to particular cultures. Today, we find absolute
destruction of the world beautiful because we secretly wish to leave
our world. Since we fear it, we wish it destroyed so we can be free
of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He gives examples of <em>I am Legend</em> and <em>The Day After Tomorrow</em>
where the destruction is “retroactively endowed with beauty” because
it makes possible a new world that is “more enjoyable than our
present” (24-5).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>This leads us to the historical question: what is it about today’s world that we fear or don’t like?</strong></p>
<p>​1 <strong>Globalization</strong>: After 9/11 we want to isolate ourselves;
however, our economy is so entwined with the rest of the world that
this is impossible.</p>
<p>​2 <strong>Global Identity</strong>: We have become post-national in our
identities, favoring a “citizen of the world” model of identity.
However, this “stateless” identity is precisely the identity assumed
by terrorists, who are stateless actors who have no national home.</p>
<p>As a result, we fear that we are fighting our own “dark double”
(28-9). As a result, Nilges argues, that our cinema and literature
depict our fights against terror as losing battles. For example,
Jack Bauer in <em>24</em> might catch one terrorist, but the next “day” a
new terrorist plot spawns again, which he will have to battle. It is
never ending.</p>
<p>3 <strong>Crisis of the white male</strong>. Heroic, white male characters from
the 80s, like <em>Die Hard</em>’s John McClane, are useless against new
threats, like cyber warfare. In the past they could save the world;
but it today’s world their old bag of tricks don’t work. They appear
impotent.</p>
<p>​4 <strong>Rejection of social revision and pluralism</strong>: Nilges argues
that current cinema narratives reject any progressive or radical
suggestions about pluralism, and the acceptance of others into the
human family. Instead, there is a conservativism that harkens back
to more traditional arrangements. (<em>I Am Legend</em> is used as an
example).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dread vs. Anxiety</strong>. He argues that anxiety stems from a future
that is not defined, where there is great doubt and uncertainty.
Dread, on the other hand, is when you contemplate something that you
know for certain will happen. Our current era is one of anxiety. The
representation or narrative of destruction represents a desire to
escape the anxiety of our time and return nostalgically to a past,
when thing were more defined and certain (29-30).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Return to Paternalism</strong>. The age of terrorism produces a crisis of
masculinity which creates a nostalgic desire to return to a more
paternalistic and conservative social structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hypermasculinity</strong>: This also promotes a kind of
“hypermasculinity” which perhaps might relate to things like
“prepping,” survivalists, increased gun ownership, spectacles of
violence, etc. Returns to nature, like in <em>Survivor</em>, etc.</p>
