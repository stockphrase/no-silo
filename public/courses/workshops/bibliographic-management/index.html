<h1 id="bibliographic-management">Bibliographic Management</h1>
<p>When I was a kid my Dad would make my brother and me do yardwork with him. We did all kinds of work, but mostly I remember raking leaves in the fall.</p>
<p>On one particular fall day my brother and I were horsing around instead of working. We were just little kids, and we would have preferred to be doing anything other than this job. So we raked a series of trails through the yard and chased each other, pretending that we were in the video game <a href="https://www.google.com/logos/2010/pacman10-i.html">Pac-Man</a>.</p>
<p>My Dad got frustrated with us and sat us down to teach us a lesson. &ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the job is the job. It has to get done. What you&rsquo;re doing is making extra work for yourselves.&rdquo; Gesturing to our system of trails with a leather-gloved hand, he said, &ldquo;Never rake the same ground twice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That last line has stayed with me for a long time. And I think it is pretty good advice for students and researchers.</p>

<p>Most of us take a very shortsighted approach to our work. We listen to lectures. We take notes. We do the reading. We complete the assignments and turn in all our work. But then we just move on. All the work product from our labors and the materials we used for learning are abandoned; ultimately, they cross into the black hole of a computer hard drive, never to emerge again. But that essay you wrote freshman year, the notes you took on a scholarly article, the readings you dutifully annotated in your history class, may be very useful to you in some future project that you canâ€™t even imagine now. Summarily tossing all of your work into the black hole forces you to start over again and again. But successful scholars and students return to prior work and research all the time&mdash;reshaping, repurposing, reusing, and extending prior efforts. They understand that knowledge is cumulative: it accretes and deepens over time, often by building on what came before. In short, they never rake the same ground twice.</p>
<p>Most of us fail at this. It&rsquo;s just human nature to focus on the immediate task at hand. But it is important to take a less nearsighted approach to your education and think about what you are doing here on a much longer timeline. Your future self may really benefit from the paper you write today or the notes you took last week or the readings you will do this term. It is impossible to know what your future self will need or be interested in, so it is best to save all you can.</p>
<p>There are many possible ways to archive your work and resources. A notebook and a filing cabinet would work fine, for example. But there are more powerful choices. One amazing project you should try out is bibliographic manager called <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>&mdash;a free and powerful piece of software that can help you with many aspects of your research work. Zotero not only helps you preserve an organized record of your work and reading, it is also powerful tool to help you perform research and complete some of the more annoying and time-consuming aspects of research writing.</p>
<h2 id="using-zotero">Using Zotero</h2>
<p>This video is a short demonstration of some of the key features of Zotero.</p>

</div>

<h2 id="workshop">Workshop</h2>
<p>I am pretty sensitive about people asking me to install things on my computer. So I won&rsquo;t require that you do so. You choose your own tools. However, if Zotero seems like something that would be useful to you, install it on your machine and take it for a spin. Zotero is free, open-source, has a huge buy-in from many library systems, is easy to use, and will make your life easier. But your choice.</p>
