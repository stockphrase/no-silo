These reference texts introduce students to the conventions of academic writing and often include chapters on academic research, critical thinking, grammar, and formal citation.\nThe knowledge contained in these texts is indispensable. However, most handbooks on the market today are bloated in both content and price (I think the former is often the justification for the latter). For example, the institution where I formerly worked required students to purchase a handbook that was over 900 pages long and cost around $60. I think that is too long and too much.\nMy goal for this project is to create a brief handbook with everything students need to successfully navigate their college writing assignments, then give it away for free.\nYou\u0026rsquo;re welcome!\nAlan C.

Ideally, this assignment would be completed during the calm after exams while you are at home with your families. Your responses to the questions below will be used in a conference during the first week of classes this winter.\nI. Review your writing Gather together all of the drafts from the three major writing assignments of the term. (You are saving all your work, right?) Re-read the drafts for each of the main essay assignments in order, from first draft to final draft. Take time to compare the pieces and notice how they evolved due to your own process of revision and in response to the commentary you received from your professor and fellow students.\nFor each of the three essays, write down a response to the following questions:\n How did your essay change from first draft to final form? What was particularly strong about this revised, final version? What things could you still improve in this final draft? What were you particularly proud of in the final draft? Considering the whole process of writing this essay, what did you learn?  II. Review your learning  Thinking about your experience of the class as a whole, what have you learned? Was there something you expected to learn, but didn\u0026rsquo;t? Are there specific things you would like to work on in the winter term? What is your biggest struggle as a writer and student?  III. Review your participation  How many classes or TA sessions did you miss? How engaged were you in the class? Did you complete all the assignments? Were all the assignments turned in on time? Did you give your best effort on each assignment? Expressed as a percentage, how much of the reading did you do? How much did you contribute to Hive? Was this your best effort at sharing/helping others? How often did you contribute on discussion days? Could you have contributed more to the conversation?  IV.

These projects and clubs are forms of self-improvement\u0026mdash;kinds of sovereign inquiry\u0026mdash;but they completely dwarf his responsibilities in the traditional disciplines of formal education: geometry, history, English, etc. According to Dr. Guggenheim, Max is \u0026ldquo;one of the worst students\u0026rdquo; at Rushmore Academy.\nBut what might Paulo Freire argue about Max\u0026rsquo;s behavior as a human being and a scholar? How might we use Freire\u0026rsquo;s ideas from \u0026ldquo;The \u0026lsquo;Banking\u0026rsquo; Concept of Education\u0026rdquo; to analyze or judge the educational trajectory and behavior of Max?\nTaking what you know of Freire\u0026rsquo;s thinking in \u0026ldquo;The \u0026lsquo;Banking\u0026rsquo; Concept of Education,\u0026rdquo; write a theoretical analysis of Wes Anderson\u0026rsquo;s Rushmore.\nUse Freire\u0026rsquo;s essay as as theoretical lens. You will have to work hard to provide your audience proper context\u0026mdash;explanations of Freire\u0026rsquo;s ideas and arguments which you will then use as a means of interpreting Rushmore. Imagine that your audience has not read Freire\u0026rsquo;s essay. What ideas, arguments, and terms from Freire\u0026rsquo;s essay will you need to carefully explain so that the audience will understand how they may be used to arrive at a new understanding of the film?\n For more information on writing a theoretical argument.  Example of Theoretical Analysis Here is a slice of a theoretical analysis that might give you a sense of how to use the theory and provide proper context for your analysis:\n Although Freire argues that liberation education culminates in a a collective effort to change the world, Max\u0026rsquo;s efforts in this regard fail to embrace the communitarian philosophy that Freire espouses. Freire insists that education and knowledge may only exist in dialogue\u0026mdash;in the open exchange of ideas between equal partners engaged in a process of mutual inquiry (88). For Freire, these moments of co-inquiry inevitably lead to praxis\u0026mdash;where the views, ideas, and values held by a community are used to transform the world into a more democratic and free society (75). While Max is keen to change the world, shaping it to his needs and wants, his praxis is always self-interested; he fails to understand Freire\u0026rsquo;s imperatives of community, dialog, and consensus. In essence, rather than shape the world with others, as Freire implores, Max insists on altering the world for himself alone.\nThere are numerous examples of Max\u0026rsquo;s selfish failure to engage in the types of communication that Freire recommends. For example, [blah, blah, blah].\n Stills from Rushmore When we analyze a film or images we can do much more than merely discuss the narrative arc or the dialog. The movie is a visual medium, so how do the images convey meaning? Costuming, gestures, body positioning, props, camera angles, lighting, framing, etc. help to construct a mood and signify meanings that we may interpret. In short, a film is a text. And when we write about film, we pay attention to how it is constructed to produce these effects by performing \u0026ldquo;close readings\u0026rdquo; in our analysis. We might practice by reading one or more of these stills:\n                             Submit this assignment to Canvas\n"});index.add({'id':8,'href':'/courses/writing-2/essay-2/','title':"Essay Two",'content':"Essay Two: Synthesis  Percy and Freire, each in their own way, ask us to consider the problem of authority within educational systems or experiences. Write an essay that synthesizes their thinking, explaining how they both investigate the nature of this problem, examine its consequences, and offer solutions.\nAs the name suggests, synthesis essays focus on combining and connecting. Your focus in a synthesis essay is to explain to your audience the ways in which two or more arguments or ideas relate to one another.\nStudents attempting synthesis for the first time often make the mistake of organizing their essays by source. For example, they will introduce two authors in their introduction, summarize Author A, summarize Author B, then conclude by noting the broad similarities and differences in the two authors’ thinking. This is not synthesis.\nIn a synthesis essay you should try to organize your essay by topic or questions at issue rather than by sources. Rather than try to summarize the essays separately, a synthesis will attempt to discover the various things that the authors discuss\u0026mdash;the questions, ideas, and arguments they have in common\u0026mdash;then present those things in an organized and meaningful way. Thus, your objective in a synthesis is to bring two or more distinct sources into a relationship by explaining to your reader the various ways in which the sources are in dialogue.\nTo begin a synthesis, ask yourself the following questions about the readings you plan to synthesize:\n What are the positions, arguments, and ideas that the source materials have in common? Are the authors all concerned about the same problem(s)? Are their arguments similar or do they differ? What reasoning supports their arguments? Do they offer similar conclusions or are there significant differences?\n After answering these questions exhaustively, write an essay that examines the relationship between the various authors’ arguments, comparing and contrasting their views.\n Synthesis is very textual in nature: you must show explicit textual evidence for each of the claims you attribute to the other authors. Using summary, paraphrase, and quotation, compare and contrast the authors’ positions; make sure to cite each of these appropriately. Use clear signal phrases to transition between your presentations of the various author’s ideas or works. We will do some work during upcoming workshops to think about structure, content, and strategies for writing.

Four or more unexcused absences may result in repercussions ranging from significant reduction in GPA to failure of the course. If you have an event that conflicts with participation in the course, please contact me beforehand to discuss appropriate accommodations.\nPapers You will submit three formal essays and several smaller writing assignments in response to our readings and class discussions. The formal essays focus on argumentation, synthesis, close reading, and theoretical analysis. The exact nature and objective of each assignment will be explained in greater detail throughout the course of the term.\n  Formatting: During the fall term papers must be submitted in the MLA style; in the winter term we will transition to the Chicago style. Information on these styles may be found in the Open Handbook.\n  Revisions: It is my practice to return essay drafts to you within one week. Afterward, you will have a minimum of one week to revise your writing. During this two-week revision cycle please feel free to drop by my office hours (or make an appointment) to go over your writing or discuss your ideas.\n  Typical Weekly Workflow Here is a list of the typical assignments and activities that we will do each week:\n  Before we meet to discuss a reading as a class, each of you should carefully read and critically engage the text on your own\u0026mdash;interrogating, analyzing, and questioning the arguments, ideas, and assumptions you discover there.\n  As you read, I ask that you annotate the text\u0026mdash;that is, mark up the text by adding meaningful symbols, marginal notes, and questions on the document itself.  Note1: This requires that you print out the text before you begin reading it.  Note2: Readings from the Open Handbook do not need to be printed out or annotated. Bring this annotated copy of the reading with you to class to help you engage in the group discussion and analysis.\n  After annotating the text, take critical notes on the text in a separate document. These notes will be valuable to you later, when you write your essays.\n  After annotating and taking notes, contribute to Hive\u0026mdash;our open-source repository of notes, ideas, and questions about our course readings.\n  The following three numbered sections explain each of these practices in more detail:\nI. Annotating Texts Rather than use a laptop or tablet to read our course readings, I ask that you print them out and annotate them as part of your preparations for class. Annotation refers to the process of marking up a text by adding your own words and symbols to the document itself. There is no right or wrong way to mark up a text, but you should develop a system that you are comfortable with and try to stick with it. Your objective in annotation is to flag the key elements of a piece of writing\u0026mdash;the thesis, argumentative claims, and pieces of evidence. In addition, use the margins of the text to ask questions, make brief notes, indicate confusion, define unfamiliar terms, and make connections to other texts. This kind of work serves two purposes: first, it helps you maintain a critical focus as you read; second, it helps you later if the text must be used for study or your own writing. If you plan on being successful in college, the ability to rigorously annotate texts is perhaps the most helpful and important skill you can develop.\n  It is not required to print out and annotate readings from the Open Handbook.   Further advice and caveats about annotation may be found in the \u0026ldquo;Annotation and Critical Reading\u0026rdquo; chapter of the Open Handbook.   II. Critical Reading Notes Create an electronic document for composing critical notes. Take detailed notes on each reading. Since you will write essays about these texts, these notes will be of significant help to you later. Your aims here should be to 1) reduce the entire argument to its bare essentials using paraphrase, summary, and selective quotation\u0026mdash;carefully documenting page numbers during this activity; 2) interrogate the text by asking questions, raising objections, and making observations; 3) connect and compare the reading to others we have read; 4) define any unfamiliar terms and link the text to any outside research you perform. At the end of this rigorous process you should have a simplified version of the essay as well as a number of critical observations, questions, and ideas that emerged in the process of reading.\n For more detailed information on the creation and purpose of these notes, read the chapter on \u0026ldquo;Critical Notes\u0026rdquo; in the Open Handbook,   III. Contribute to Hive Hive is an open-source repository containing notes, ideas, and questions about our course readings and class discussions. We will build this resource together as a class\u0026mdash;sharing the work of interpreting, analyzing, and questioning the complex course readings we encounter.\nWe will use shared  Google docs to create the Hive resource. Each reading in this syllabus has an attached Google doc located in a link beneath it. There is a Hive document dedicated to your course section, so please make sure to make your contribution to the proper one. You may distinguish the documents by examining the notations, as in the example below:\n  6 : Hive page for section 6 @ C hour  7 : Hive page for section 7 @ D hour   You must use your Dartmouth login credentials to access the drive, not your personal Gmail account. Please authenticate using this G-Suite link: https://google.dartmouth.edu/  Our objective for Hive is to explore meaning, discover argumentative structures, evaluate supporting evidence, ask probing questions, connect to other readings, link to relevant resources, and think critically about the implications of a text. The “hive mind” is capable of discovering and creating far more than any one individual. With luck, Hive will become a central resource in our class discussions and an indispensable aid to you as you craft your essays.\nYou might contribute to Hive by doing some of the following tasks:\n  Help create a simplified version of the text’s argumentative structure by presenting an ordered list of claims, reasons, and evidence.\n  Ask a question about a difficult passage in the text or offer an answer to one posed by another student.\n  Define difficult vocabulary.\n  Flag a key portion of the essay that seems worthy of discussion or analysis and explain why it seems significant, or build on the thought of another student who has done so.\n  Make a connection between an idea found in one text with others we have read in class (or elsewhere).\n  Constructively question, respond, or correct the ideas or work of another student.\n  Grading Decades of research on grading concludes that it is counterproductive, even harmful, to the process of education. If you care to examine it for yourself, Alfie Kohn has conveniently summarized the key findings of this scholarship.\nFor the reasons described by Kohn (and other ones we will explore together), this class will not feature traditional letter grades for evaluation. To be sure, I will evaluate your writing and give you rigorous feedback on how to improve. You will receive similar feedback from your colleagues in the class. And you will also perform reflective self-evaluation of your writing and thinking. But at no point will this complex, important work be reduced to a percentage or letter grade.\nAt the end of the term we will reflect together on your progress, effort, participation, and performance; we will decide together what final grade to enter into Banner. This discussion about your performance in the class will involve our mutual reflection on the following topics:\n Participation Attendance Collaboration and sharing Late, incomplete, missing work Growth Effort  This list was partially inspired by the grading contract in Asao B. Inoue\u0026rsquo;s Labor-based Grading Contracts.\n Help With Your Writing There are many sources of help for your writing assignments. I am happy to meet with you all term during my office hours or by appointment. Each of you will meet with our TA for 45 minutes per week to go over your writing and plan revision. If you require further help, the RWIT program offers excellent peer tutoring on all phases of the writing process\u0026mdash;from generating ideas to formal citation.\nStudents With Disabilities All students are entitled to full access to this course, regardless of disability. If you have a disability and anticipate needing accommodations in this course, please contact me as soon as possible to arrange a confidential meeting. Students requiring disability-related services must register with the Student Accessibility Services office. Once SAS has authorized services, students must show the originally signed SAS Services and Consent Form and/or a letter on SAS letterhead to me. If you have questions about whether you qualify to receive academic adjustments and services, you should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions will remain confidential.\nSymbol Legend    Symbol Note      Synchronous class day via Zoom    Independent work day from home    Conferences with professor    A new major assignment    Workshop assignment    Assignment due    Upload assignment to Canvas    Contribute to Hive    Peer work, in pairs or groups    Discussion topic    Course reading from the Open Handbook    Course reading download (.pdf)    Question of the Day™     | Friday [Soap Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soapbox) --- Schedule of Readings and Assignments Week One   {  } Monday, 9.14  + In-class work   Question of the Day™ Review: syllabus, course policies, websites Time for questions  + Assignments   What is education?

Canvas Submit assignments, contact others, view media.   Hive A shared Google drive for collaborative work.    Academic Honesty All work submitted in this course must be your own and be written exclusively for this course. The use of sources (ideas, quotations, paraphrase) must be properly documented. Please read the Academic Honor Principle for more information about the dire consequences of plagiarism. If you are confused about when or how to cite information, please consult the course handbook or ask me about it before submitting your work.\nAttendance Regular attendance is expected. Bracketing religious observance, severe illness, or personal tragedy, no more than three unexcused absences in a single term will be acceptable for this course. This policy applies to regular class meetings, assigned X hours, and TA meetings. Four or more unexcused absences may result in repercussions ranging from significant reduction in GPA to failure of the course. If you have an event that conflicts with participation in the course, please contact me beforehand to discuss appropriate accommodations.\nPapers You will submit three formal essays and several smaller writing assignments in response to our readings and class discussions. The formal essays focus on argumentation, synthesis, close reading, and theoretical analysis. The exact nature and objective of each assignment will be explained in greater detail throughout the course of the term.\n  Formatting: During the fall term papers must be submitted in the MLA style; in the winter term we will transition to the Chicago style. Information on these styles may be found in the Open Handbook.\n  Late Papers: Late papers will receive a full letter grade deduction for each day late.\n  Revisions: It is my practice to return essay drafts to you within one week. Afterward, you will have a minimum of one week to revise your writing. During this two-week revision cycle please feel free to drop by my office hours (or make an appointment) to go over your writing or discuss your ideas.\n  Typical Weekly Workflow Here is a list of the typical assignments and activities that we will do each week:\n  Before we meet to discuss a reading as a class, each of you should carefully read and critically engage the text on your own\u0026mdash;interrogating, analyzing, and questioning the arguments, ideas, and assumptions you discover there.\n  As you read, I ask that you annotate the text\u0026mdash;that is, mark up the text by adding meaningful symbols, marginal notes, and questions on the document itself.  Note: This requires that you print out the text before you begin reading it. Bring this annotated copy of the reading with you to class to help you engage in the group discussion and analysis.\n  After annotating the text, take critical notes on the text in a separate document. These notes will be valuable to you later, when you write your essays.\n  After annotating and taking notes, contribute to Hive\u0026mdash;our open-source repository of notes, ideas, and questions about our course readings.\n  The following three numbered sections explain each of these practices in more detail:\nI. Annotating Texts Rather than use a laptop or tablet to read our course readings, I ask that you print them out and annotate them as part of your preparations for class. Annotation refers to the process of marking up a text by adding your own words and symbols to the document itself. There is no right or wrong way to mark up a text, but you should develop a system that you are comfortable with and try to stick with it. Your objective in annotation is to flag the key elements of a piece of writing\u0026mdash;the thesis, argumentative claims, and pieces of evidence. In addition, use the margins of the text to ask questions, make brief notes, indicate confusion, define unfamiliar terms, and make connections to other texts. This kind of work serves two purposes: first, it helps you maintain a critical focus as you read; second, it helps you later if the text must be used for study or your own writing. If you plan on being successful in college, the ability to rigorously annotate texts is perhaps the most helpful and important skill you can develop.\n+ Further advice and caveats about annotation may be found in the \u0026ldquo;Annotation and Critical Reading\u0026rdquo; chapter of the Open Handbook.  II. Critical Reading Notes Create an electronic document for composing critical notes. Take detailed notes on each reading. Since you will write essays about these texts, these notes will be of significant help to you later. Your aim here should be to reduce the entire argument to its bare essentials using paraphrase, summary, and selective quotation. Carefully document page numbers during this activity. Interrogate the text by asking questions, raising objections, and making observations. Connect and compare the reading to others we have read. Link to any outside research you perform and define unfamiliar terms or words. At the end of this process you should have a simplified version of the essay as well as a number of critical observations, questions, and ideas that emerged in the process of reading.\n+ For more detailed information on the creation and purpose of these notes, read the chapter on \u0026ldquo;Critical Notes\u0026rdquo; in the Open Handbook.  III. Contribute to Hive Hive is an open-source repository containing notes, ideas, and questions about our course readings and class discussions. We will build this resource together as a class\u0026mdash;sharing the work of interpreting, analyzing, and questioning the complex course readings we encounter.\nWe will use shared  Google docs to create the Hive resource. Each reading in the WR2 syllabus has an attached Google doc located in a link beneath it. Each of my course sections has their own dedicated Hive page. Please make sure to make your contribution to the proper course section, indicated with the following notations:\n  6 : Hive page for section 6  7 : Hive page for section 7  + You must use your Dartmouth login credentials to access the drive, not your personal Gmail account. Please authenticate using this G-Suite link: https://google.dartmouth.edu/  Our objective for Hive is to explore meaning, discover argumentative structures, evaluate supporting evidence, ask probing questions, connect to other readings, link to relevant resources, and think critically about the implications of a text. The “hive mind” is capable of discovering and uncovering far more than any one individual. With luck, Hive will become a central resource in our class discussions and an indispensable aid to you as you craft your essays.\nYou might contribute to Hive by doing some of the following tasks:\n   Help create a simplified version of the text’s argumentative structure by presenting an ordered list of claims, reasons, and evidence.\n  Ask a question about a difficult passage in the text or offer an answer to one posed by another student.\n  Define difficult vocabulary.\n  Flag a key portion of the essay that seems worthy of discussion or analysis and explain why it seems significant, or build on the thought of another student who has done so.\n  Make a connection between an idea found in one text with others we have read in class (or elsewhere).\n  Constructively question, respond, or correct the ideas or work of another student.\n   Grading Breakdown The following assignments comprise your grade for the fall term:\n   Assignment Percentage     Essay One 20%   Essay Two 30%   Essay Three 30%   Workshops 10%   Participation 10%    Help With Your Writing There are many sources of help for your writing assignments. I am happy to meet with you all term during my office hours or by appointment. Each of you will meet with our TA for 45 minutes per week to go over your writing and plan revision. If you require further help, the RWIT program offers excellent peer tutoring on all phases of the writing process\u0026mdash;from generating ideas to formal citation.\nStudents With Disabilities All students are entitled to full access to this course, regardless of disability. If you have a disability and anticipate needing accommodations in this course, please contact me as soon as possible to arrange a confidential meeting. Students requiring disability-related services must register with the Student Accessibility Services office. Once SAS has authorized services, students must show the originally signed SAS Services and Consent Form and/or a letter on SAS letterhead to me.

Why do we produce novels, films, and other forms of art that contemplate the end of humanity? Scholars from many disciplines have offered theories about the appeal and meaning of such spectacles of apocalyptic destruction. We will read some of this critical literature, examining views from disciplines such as psychology, sociology, cultural studies, and religion. In addition to these assigned readings, each of you will engage in your own original process of inquiry on a related topic of your choosing. You will present your findings frequently to the community of scholars in our class, sharing and discussing your research discoveries and insights. Ultimately, you will produce a lengthy work of original scholarship that will contribute to this field of inquiry\n Course Objectives Writing 3 continues our focus on inquiry, critical thinking, and argumentation. The course additionally involves an introduction to academic research. Our libraries hold an impressive collection of traditional and electronic research tools as well as hundreds of thousands of books, journal articles, and assorted media. Navigating this ocean of information can be intimidating; however, excellent research skills are fundamental to your training. Therefore, we will spend a significant amount of time learning how to perform academic research and use our library resources effectively. By the end of this course, you should be able to do the following:\n Formulate research questions that may be used to guide a research process. Discover background information on a topic using reference materials. Locate books, periodicals, and other physical media within library collections. Locate electronic databases and query them with precision. Understand the importance of the process known as “peer review.” Critically evaluate sources for credibility and suitability for research. Use bibliographic software and a research journal to track and manage references. Craft a lengthy argument that contributes to an ongoing critical conversation.

Grading Decades of research on grading concludes that it is counterproductive, even harmful, to the process of education. If you care to examine it for yourself, Alfie Kohn has conveniently summarized the key findings of this scholarship.\nFor the reasons described by Kohn (and ones we explored in the fall term), this class will not feature traditional letter grades for evaluation. To be sure, I will evaluate your writing and give you rigorous feedback on how to improve. You will receive similar feedback from your colleagues in the class. And you will also perform reflective self-evaluation of your writing and thinking. Ultimately, you will have to decide how best to express your ideas. But at no point will this complex, important work be reduced to a percentage or letter grade.\nAt the end of the term we will reflect together on your progress, effort, participation, and performance; we will decide together what final grade to enter into Banner. This discussion about your performance in the class will involve our mutual reflection on the following topics:\n Participation Attendance Collaboration and sharing Late, incomplete, missing work Growth Effort   This list was partially inspired by the grading contract in Asao B. Inoue\u0026rsquo;s Labor-based Grading Contracts.   Major Assignments 1. Formal Research Essay You will write one formal research essay, 15 pages or more in length. The project will involve many of the core competencies we developed in the previous term including argumentation, critical thinking, close reading, synthesis, and theoretical analysis. You may write on any topic you wish, so long as it is a contribution to our course conversation and theme. Please discuss your ideas with me before you get too far along. I am happy to meet with each of you to discuss ideas and help formulate a research plan.\n The essay must be submitted in the Chicago format and contain a minimum of 15 peer-reviewed sources.  2. Research Workshops Several workshop assignments will help you gain confidence with using library resources, constructing bibliographies, and managing a large research project.\n3. Presentations You will make one formal presentation at the conclusion of the term to explain your research project to our class. You will also make a number of informal presentations about your ideas, research, and writing as they evolve over the term. These informal presentations may not be announced, so be prepared to discuss your project at any time.\n4. Author Page Each of you will curate a webpage dedicated to your research project. We will call this site your Author Page. You may create this page as a shared Google Doc or use the Dartmouth Journeys platform. After creating your page, link to it on the course research projects page so that we may locate it. We will use these Author Pages to view your project as it evolves over time. One of your most important responsibilities this term is to keep this page updated. Your author page should contain the following:\n a short research proposal/statement of no more than 250 words. an annotated bibliography of all the sources used or consulted to construct your research project (use permalinks to link to the book or article within the library system). a current draft of your research essay. a weekly reflective blog post about the progress of your research project (see #7 below).   I have placed a model author page on the course website.  5. Contribute to Hive Hive is an open-source repository containing notes, ideas, and questions about our course readings and class discussions. We will build this resource together as a class\u0026mdash;sharing the work of interpreting, analyzing, and questioning the complex course texts we encounter.\nWe will use shared  Google docs to create the Hive resource. Each week containing course readings or films has a dedicated Hive document for the week. There is a Hive document dedicated to your individual course section, so please make sure to make your contribution to the proper one. You may distinguish between these two documents by examining the superscript notations, as in the examples below:\n  6 : Hive page for section 6 @ C hour  7 : Hive page for section 7 @ D hour   You must use your Dartmouth login credentials to access the shared drive, not your personal Gmail account.

Ask a question about a difficult passage in the text or offer an answer to one posed by another student. Define difficult vocabulary. Flag a key portion of the essay or film that seems worthy of discussion or analysis and explain why it seems significant, or build on the thought of another student who has done so. Make a connection between an idea found in one text with others we have read in class (or elsewhere). Constructively question, respond, or correct the ideas or work of another student.  6. Critical Reading Notes Take detailed notes on each course text. Your aim here should be to reduce the entire argument to its bare essentials using paraphrase, summary, and selective quotation. Carefully document page numbers during this activity. Interrogate the text by asking questions, raising objections, and noting observations. Connect and compare the reading to others we have read. Link to any outside research you perform and define unfamiliar terms or words. At the end of this process, you should have a simplified version of the essay as well as a number of critical observations, questions, and ideas that emerged as you read. If the text is a film, take detailed notes on elements of the film that seem significant. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to note the timestamp.\n For more detailed information on the creation and purpose of these notes, read the chapter entitled “Annotation and Critical Reading” in the Open Handbook.  7. End-of-Week Journal Reflection Compose a weekly reflective \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo; post on your Author Page that details your efforts that week to further your research project. At the beginning, these posts will likely be searching, inarticulate musings as you think out loud about something you\u0026rsquo;d like to research. However, as your research intensifies and comes into focus, these posts should begin to include the steps that you took that week to further the project in some way. What kind of research problems or difficulties did you encounter? What sources did you locate? How is the project evolving as you read and think more deeply on your subject? In essence, I would like you to blog your experiences as a novice researcher engaged in your first big research project. Significantly: the things you say in your posts will help me, the teaching assistant, and your colleagues assist you with your project.\n Help With Your Writing There are many sources of help for your writing assignments. I am happy to meet with you all term during my office hours or by appointment. Each of you will meet with our TA for 45 minutes per week to go over your writing and plan revision. If you require further help, the RWIT program offers excellent peer tutoring on all phases of the writing process\u0026mdash;from generating ideas to formal citation.\n Required Conference Each of you must attend a brief conference with me and our teaching assistant during the first two weeks of class. During this meeting we will discuss the Fall Reflection and Review assignment you completed over the holiday break. We will decide together what grade you earned during the fall term.\nThe meeting is also designed to discuss any concerns that you may have about the fall term or any goals that you may have going forward into the winter term. If there are particular things you would like to work on in your writing, please come prepared to discuss them.\n To sign up for a session, use the schedule here. All meetings will be held in my office hour Zoom room.   Students With Disabilities All students are entitled to full access to this course, regardless of disability.

A key concept in this conversation is the “state of nature,” a hypothetical condition where human beings lived without government. In this primitive state there is no law or authority, only anarchy and the pervasive threat of violence. Thinkers of the past such as Hobbes, Rousseau, and Locke used this hypothetical condition to explain why the state of nature no longer exists and how civilized orders came to be. Today, however, many writers, filmmakers, and social scientists imagine apocalyptic scenarios of disaster wherein society regresses again to chaotic states of nature.

During these moments of extreme social stress, cultures transmute fear, anxiety, or dread into popular art forms such as novels or films. Thus, by examining popular media produced during these particular historical moments we are afforded a glimpse of how a culture worked through difficult social problems, reacted to challenges to its foundational values, and related to its various “Others.” In this section we will examine two films, The Last Man on Earth (1964) and I am Legend (2007), both adaptations of Richard Mattheson’s 1954 novel I Am Legend. What cultural anxieties or problems do these films articulate? What social solutions do they seem to offer? Significantly, how do the differences between these two films provide a metric for measuring the evolving concerns of America from the 1960s to today?\n  6 Hive page for Week 4  7 Hive page for Week 4   {  } Monday, 1.25  + Texts   Film, The Last Man on Earth (1968).

This begs several questions. Why was the zombie born here rather than someplace else? What is it about the Americas and their history that made the figure of the zombie possible and popular? What does it say about us and our culture that we have created precisely this type of monster? In this section we will attempt to answer these questions by tracing the evolution of the zombie—from its origins in the slave-based plantation cultures of the Americas through modern interpretations of the figure in contemporary literature and film. Significantly, the zombie of today differs markedly from its precursors in the cinema of the 30s, 40s, and 50s. In these earlier films the zombie was a figure within an imperialist discourse that expressed racist ideologies and the anxieties of post-slavery cultures throughout the Americas. However, just as the figure of the zombie had nearly been forgotten, a new form of the creature appeared in 1968 in George Romero’s Night of the Living Dead. No longer was the zombie a folkloric figure born of the struggle between master and slave; now it was an mindless, cannibalistic creature that stalked the countryside in swarms, mindlessly searching for human flesh. How do we account for this sudden transformation of the zombie? What cultural “work” did the zombie perform?\n  6 Hive page for Week 6  7 Hive page for Week 6   {  } Monday, 2.8  + Texts   Film, Night of the Living Dead (1968).

Popular shows in this regard include game shows like Survivor and adventure shows like Man vs. Wild and Survivorman. Newer programming includes the Discovery Channel’s Dude, You’re Screwed, Alaska Bush People, Dual Survival, and the rather prurient Naked and Afraid. While these shows give viewers the vicarious thrill of braving the wilderness from the comfort of their armchairs, there has recently been an explosion in real survivalist culture, known as “prepping.” Preppers build bomb shelters and other fortifications where they stockpile food, supplies, firearms, and ammunition in preparation for TEOTWAWKI: The end of the world as we know it. A number of shows have emerged in response: Doomsday Preppers, Doomsday Castle, and Doomsday Bunker. The list of prepper fears is long: generalized civil unrest, total social collapse, global weather catastrophes, the return of Christ, peak oil, attacks using EMPs, and, of course, zombies. Are these views largely fueled by paranoia or a desire for self-reliance? Do these fears and anxieties signify some larger, unarticulated criticism or anxiety about modernity or capitalism?\n  6 Hive page for Week 7  7 Hive page for Week 7   {  } Monday, 2.15  + Texts    Doomsday Preppers.\n   Casey Kelly, “The Man-pocalypse: Doomsday Preppers and the Rituals of Apocalyptic Manhood.”\n  + Lectures \u0026amp; Workshops  Workshop 8: Managing Large Research Projects   How do you begin when you\u0026rsquo;ve collected a large pile of books and articles that will be parts of your research project?

In particular, Nixon’s focus in his influential work Slow Violence is on climate disaster: the slow-moving catastrophes of rising sea levels, mounting greenhouse gasses, toxic waste, nuclear accidents, deforestation, and acidifying oceans. These catastrophes, Nixon argues, are difficult to apprehend or represent in narrative form because they take place over years, decades, lifetimes, generations; as “spectacle deficient” events, they struggle for representation in a media environment that is biased toward more sensational forms of violence. Yet, these forms of ecocide are forms of violence surely, ones that remain invisible to many of us because they principally affect the impoverished and forgotten global poor. How can we recalibrate our perceptions to cognize these forms of slow violence? How do we convert “slow violence” into narrative form so that we can communicate its dangers, raise public awareness, and mobilize efforts for change?\n  6 Hive page for Week 8  7 Hive page for Week 8   {  } Monday, 2.22  + Texts   Rob Nixon, Slow Violence and the Environmentalism of the Poor, “Introduction.”  + Independent work  Print out, read, annotate, and take critical notes on the reading, then post your contributions to the week\u0026rsquo;s Hive page.

Like a hawk over a field, it is on the lookout for something vulnerable. Then it is a pleasure to swoop and skewer the victim with the nib\u0026rsquo;s sharp point. The mere fact of holding the hand poised for action changes our attitude to the text. We are no longer passive consumers of a monologue but active participants in a dialogue.\n\u0026mdash; Tim Parks, \u0026ldquo;A Weapon for Readers\u0026rdquo;\n  In college you will encounter demanding texts of great complexity. You will be asked to engage these texts critically and to challenge the thinking and conclusions of others. You will also have to retain an extraordinary amount of information and recall it later. To thrive in this environment you will need to develop some new habits and strategies. The most basic, and most important, of these are a formal procedure for the annotation of texts and the creation of critical summary notes.\nAnnotating texts Analysis involves breaking an argument down into smaller parts so that you can understand how those parts work together to make the whole. The best way to begin the process of analysis is to annotate texts as you read them by using a system of symbols and marginal notes made on the document itself. There is no right or wrong way to mark up a text, but you should develop a system that you are comfortable with and try to stick with it. Writing while you read will help you stay focused and read critically. In fact, I would argue that if you are not writing while you read\u0026mdash;by putting it into your own words through annotation, summary, paraphrase, and quotation\u0026mdash;then you are not reading critically at all.\nYour objective in annotation is to flag the key elements of a piece of writing\u0026mdash;such as the thesis, claims, reasons, and key pieces of evidence. This kind of work serves two purposes. First, it helps you maintain a critical focus as you read. Second, it helps you later if the text must be used for study or your own writing.\nDuring my annotations I always flag a number of things. I underline the thesis once I find it and I place large dots next to claims that are being used to support the thesis. I always place keywords or a short statement next to each paragraph, aiming to create a \u0026ldquo;micro summary\u0026rdquo; of the content. I use check marks or exclamation points next to statements that I find important or noteworthy. Sometimes I draw arrows or reference other page numbers to connect parts of an essay that seem related to me in some way.\nIn addition to flagging and summarizing a text\u0026rsquo;s key ideas, claims, and arguments, I also ask questions in the margins or note places where I become confused. This is helpful later, on my second reading, since I can pay more careful attention to the passages that gave me trouble. I also write my thoughts as they occur to me and state objections to things that seem problematic or wrongheaded. Sometimes I try to connect an idea in one text with the idea(s) in another text I have read. Making these sorts of connections is a central feature of the kind of thinking and writing you will do in college.\nAs you can see from the example page below, the process of annotation keeps me engaged, active, and alert\u0026mdash;key components in critical thinking.\n   The false allure of the highlighter Students often associate critical thinking and a general studiousness with the use of a highlighter. However, I\u0026rsquo;d like to question this practice a bit. Compare the following selection from a student\u0026rsquo;s course reading to the annotation practices outlined above:\n   There are a number of problems worth noting here about the practice of highlighting while reading:\n  First, your objective when you read something should be to avoid having to read it again (unless, of course, you would enjoy doing so). Highlighting important portions of a text, as this student has done, only signals that the highlighted bits were important to the reader at the time of the reading. But to discover why they are important or what the highlighted portions mean, the student will be forced to read the text again. Busy students studying for multiple midterms do not have time to re-read entire books or articles.\n  Secondly, highlighting works against critical thinking by casting the reader in the passive role of information consumer. As Keith Hjortshoj argues, highlighting merely \u0026ldquo;emphasizes the authority of the text: what its author says, believes, or knows. The practice therefore leads you toward memorization and repetition, not toward interpretation, inquiry, or criticism\u0026rdquo; (41). While recalling information at a later time is important, this is not the sole purpose of reading. Critical reading also involves a process of evaluating, questioning, and interpreting the text\u0026mdash;activities that highlighting actively resists.\n  Thirdly, highlighting doesn\u0026rsquo;t help you place the information into your long-term memory. Recent research suggests that taking notes by hand results in a significant boost to information retention.\n  Finally, highlighting doesn\u0026rsquo;t help you understand the structure of an argument\u0026mdash;the main goal of any critical analysis. Arguments all have a certain structure: there is a main idea supported by a series of claims, reasons, and pieces of supporting evidence. The highlighter fails to reveal this structure. Flagging key structural features of arguments (as described above in the process of annotation) will dramatically reduce the time it takes to study and will be of significant help in your writing as you make use of the texts in question.\n  Annotation strategies Since you have likely never engaged a text in such a manner, here are some strategies that you might consider as you develop a process for annotation and critical reading:\n  Use a symbol system. Develop a system of symbols to flag important aspects of a reading. Mark significant elements within the text such as the thesis, argumentative claims, and evidence. Also note when a text references other texts, authors, or events. Note places where you become confused or uncertain; later, in a second reading, you can give extra attention to these portions of the text.\n  Interrogate the text. Be ruthless. Be rigorous. Ask questions back to the author in the margins of the text. Challenge the conclusions and arguments that he or she presents by making ones of your own.\n  Summarize. Write keywords or make \u0026ldquo;microsummaries\u0026rdquo; in the margins next to each paragraph. Later, you will not have to re-read the entire document to find your place. These can be especially useful if you later use this text in your own writing.\n  Connect. Find connections between the reading and others within the course or your broader reading experience. Develop the capacity to bring other texts into dialogue with each other, imagining writing and reading as a form of social interaction.\n  "});index.add({'id':16,'href':'/courses/writing-3/observations-on-apocalypse/','title':"Aphorisms on the Post-Apocalyptic",'content':"Observations on the Post-Apocalyptic A collection of random thoughts on the post-apocalyptic narrative:\n The post-apocalyptic narrative is a fantasy or species of wish-fulfillment that expresses a desire for the end of civilization as we know it. The popularity of such films suggest a range of audience responses and psychological conditions behind this wish:    1a. Economic despair and disempowering socio-economic structuring lead to a fanciful embrace of post-apocalyptic narrative as a balm, compensation, a comfort. We imagine a future where all systems of power, all hierarchies of values, all bureaucracies and governing institutions are utterly leveled, creating a landscape of pure possibility where anything is possible. A Nietzschean \u0026ldquo;re-evaluation of all values\u0026rdquo; begins. The rigid class system enforced by unbridgeable chasms of wealth withers away, leaving only a meritocracy based in strength, wit, and a willingness to commit violence. Your station in life is determined by your fitness, not the position to which you are born: your future is no longer predetermined by your origins. A plumber becomes the leader of the new order.\n  1b. Cultural artifacts (such as film and novels) function as temporary compensations for the economic hopelessness of the underclasses under global capitalism. These narratives of destruction are received as revenge fantasies. The world that has wronged the underclasses is destroyed; the economic machine that has ground them to dust is violently dismantled; the high classes are brought low and are forced to suffer poverty, deprivation, and insecurity along with the rest.\n  1c. Many cultural artifacts articulate a powerful nostalgia\u0026mdash;a desire to return to a simpler time without the complexities and petty annoyances of life in the first world: no technology, no social media, no cable television, no traffic. No one looks at a screen anymore; instead we hold a hoe and cultivate a bean field. It is a return to the land\u0026mdash;to a bucolic, pastoral existence. However, this reverie is rarely the subject of the post-apocalyptic, which concentrates on the threat that other humans pose to each other in the state of nature. These states of rural perfection are always overturned or under threat from others.\n  1d. In some post-apocalyptic narratives the focus is on environmental regeneration; the apocalypse can pave the way for a new earth that is healed from the pollution and destruction created by mankind. Nature returns, and throws off the dominant hand of mankind to assert its supremacy. Capitalism is destroyed. The anthropocene melts away: roads, bridges, cities, infrastructure, lie in rusty heaps.\n  1e. Post-apocalyptic narratives often articulate a deep conservatism that presents a nostalgic return to more \u0026ldquo;traditional\u0026rdquo; social arrangements or structures, particularly those related to gender roles and sexual orientation/identities. In some cases this produces fantasies of a return to frankly sexist and racist social arrangements.\n  1f. The post-apocalyptic narrative depicts cults of hypermasculinity that redress the \u0026ldquo;malaise\u0026rdquo; of the modern male\u0026mdash;cowed by feminism, political correctness, and the social sanctions against putative masculine traits of competition, aggression, and violence. Fantasies of empowerment based in dominance, gun culture, adventure, subordination and control of others (particularly women) form.\n  1g. Many of these films express an incipient or perhaps secret desire to destroy civilization specifically because it is seen as enervating and feminized, lacking in masculine values or characteristics. In the critique of the quiche-eating beta male and the emasculated office cubicle drones, we see a nostalgic desire to return to the hard masculinity of the past paired with powerful neo-primitivist fantasies.\n   The post-apocalyptic signals anxiety about the loss of the symbolic traditions that previously helped us make sense of a chaotic and ambiguous universe. While our forebears inhabited a world ordered and made meaningful by a divine plan, we lack a telos; there is no longer a prevailing sense that God is at work in the wings of the world, shaping history for some future purpose, or poised to emerge deus-ex-machina to deliver us at the end. Events no longer have meaning or intent; they are merely things that happen after things that happen\u0026mdash;an apparently discontinuous and unrelated stream of phenomena governed by nothing more than the physical rules of the universe. Progress is an illusion. The zombie apocalypse genre is particularly symptomatic as it features an inversion of the Christian resurrection: the dead rise again and walk the earth without salvation.\n  A knowledge economy emerges that is centered on the forgotten practices required for the bare comforts of the human animal. Such basic, practical know-how has been so completely outsourced to technology or service industry that only a few possess the ability to: make fires, hunt for food, clean game, grow food, build shelters from raw materials, etc. The apocalypse reveals just how tenuous and interconnected the various systems are that provide for our basic needs in the present world. Foxfire books are used a currency. In other cultural domains we see the popularity of television shows based in survival, where we vicariously experience the wilderness or \u0026ldquo;prep\u0026rdquo; for various doomsday scenarios.\n  Films where climate change is the main agent of the apocalypse often use the impending disaster to show how, at long last, humans can put aside their politics or nationalism to join together as human beings to defend civilization from a shared disaster. Alternatively, films where a disease outbreak precipitates the crisis often figure mankind as irredeemable.\n  Mystery returns again to a world that had become typified by frictionless access to knowledge and the discovery of information. No longer can you: search wikipedia for a fact, connect with distant family and friends, etc. The world is now shaped by rumor, myth, sham spiritualism, magic, cults of personality; distance is an insuperable barrier to communication, organization, awareness. The universe shrinks to the local\u0026ndash;to the modest circle accessible to the human senses. But in truth, this is kind of bullshit, because social media has almost single-handedly returned us to a profoundly insular echo chamber bepopulate with chimeras, disinformation, and incitements not unlike what I described before.\n  Without powerful forms of surveillance, bureaucratic systems, persistent record-keeping, licensing, and various forms of oversight, the freedoms of anonymity return along with certain cognate possibilities such as the reinvention of the self or imposture. Who are you? Whatever you choose today. In this way the genre returns to the Western. Move on to some new town far away and reinvent yourself.\n  The alien invasion narrative is an expression of a need for human solidarity on a grand, global scale in an era of fractured identity and caustic dissensus. To defeat the enemy, we must all work together and put aside our differences: race, sex, politics, national enmity. A universalism is forged in the invasion by something so radically other that all our differences are rendered trivial, illegible.\n  "});index.add({'id':17,'href':'/courses/writing-3/author-page/','title':"Author Page Example",'content':"   This is a mockup of an Author Page for a research project.

Alan Taylor Revanchist Masculinity in Recent Post-Apocalyptic Cinema This paper examines a strain of post-apocalyptic narrative featuring what we may call “revanchist masculinity.” This term references an increasingly strident cultural discourse that addresses a perceived crisis of modern masculinity and demands a return to patriarchal authority and so-called \u0026ldquo;masculine values.\u0026rdquo; Narratives of this sort revel in neo-primitivist fantasies of male empowerment based in dominance, gun culture, adventure, hyper-masculine performances, and the subordination and control of others (particularly women). Many of these films express an incipient or perhaps secret desire to totally destroy modern civilization, which is seen as enervating and effeminate, thus returning to a \u0026ldquo;natural\u0026rdquo; order.\nCurrent Research Abrams, Robert E.

The objective in the critical outline is to boil the entire argument down to its essence without losing any significant detail. The focus, then, is on reduction: taking something complex and unwieldy and turning it into something small and useful for study or your own writing. There is a real art to this, and you will become better and faster at this as you practice. Over time, you will train your mind to operate in such a way that you will perform these tasks almost unconsciously as you read. These critical notes will be indispensable study aids. They will also dramatically improve your writing since key information, important passages, and significant quotations from the text will be easily accessible to you with minimal recovery efforts.\nThese critical summaries are comprised of nothing more than summary, paraphrase, quotation, and your own observations and questions. Quote only the most important, memorable language. Summarize or paraphrase the rest in as objective a manner as possible. Take great care when summarizing or paraphrasing; if your work is too similar to the original text and is used later in your own writing, you may inadvertently commit plagiarism, a serious academic offense. Therefore, carefully place the writing of others into your own words and cite the text and ideas you reference in your notes.\nAs you write this critical outline you will not only try to reduce the main points of the argument, you will also ask questions and make observations of the text. You should note the argumentative points that you find yourself strongly agreeing or disagreeing with and your reasons for doing so. You might see a logical inconsistency or want the author to provide more evidence for his or her claims. You might make a note to perform some research at the library or on the Internet on an unfamiliar concept or event mentioned in the argument. Ultimately, however, you will want to determine if the argument you have read is persuasive and provide the reasons why.\nAt the end of this process, you should have a simplified\u0026mdash;but objective and accurate\u0026mdash;version of the essay that has been ruthlessly cut down to its bare essentials as well as a number of critical observations, questions, and ideas that have emerged in your process of reading. By the time you reach this stage and read over your notes, you will have taken great strides toward understanding the information or argument. Of course, if the text is difficult, you may have to repeat the process until you have a breakthrough. I cannot emphasize enough how helpful and important this process is. It will help you arrive at a greater understanding of the text\u0026rsquo;s claims and weaknesses while also activating your long-term memory.\nFinally, to be a successful student and scholar, you will need to preserve your notes for later use. You might use a series of organized folders on your computer or some kind of filing system in manila folders. Whatever works best for you. Retaining all of this hard work will be of great importance to you later, particularly as you engage in large research projects. As I describe in the next chapter, being a scholar\u0026mdash;or just a great student\u0026mdash;involves reusing and re-purposing prior work and information.\nHow to take in-class notes You might consider taking your notes on paper. Some research suggests that taking notes by hand, rather than using a computer, aids memory and improves student performance:\n Obviously it is advantageous to draft more complete notes that precisely capture the course content and allow for a verbatim review of the material at a later date. Only it isn’t. New research by Pam Mueller and Daniel Oppenheimer demonstrates that students who write out their notes on paper actually learn more. Across three experiments, Mueller and Oppenheimer had students take notes in a classroom setting and then tested students on their memory for factual detail, their conceptual understanding of the material, and their ability to synthesize and generalize the information. Half of the students were instructed to take notes with a laptop, and the other half were instructed to write the notes out by hand. As in other studies, students who used laptops took more notes. In each study, however, those who wrote out their notes by hand had a stronger conceptual understanding and were more successful in applying and integrating the material than those who used took notes with their laptops.\n  Of course, we\u0026rsquo;re all different with unique strengths and challenges. So this advice may not be appropriate for everyone.  Critical notes strategies Developing a process for making critical notes is perhaps the most important new habit you will need to be successful in college. Here are some strategies or principles that may guide your efforts:\n  Reduce. Use summary, paraphrase, quotation, to reduce an argument to its bare bones.\n  Engage. Grapple with the ideas and arguments in the text. Ask questions and make observations. You should note the argumentative points that you find yourself strongly agreeing or disagreeing with and your reasons for doing so. You might see a logical inconsistency or want the author to provide more evidence for his or her claims. You might make a note to perform some research on an unfamiliar word, concept, or event mentioned in the argument.\n  Protect yourself. Be scrupulous when you summarize and paraphrase source materials in your notes by ensuring that you use your own language and sentence structure. A lazy mistake at this stage may cost you dearly later if you inadvertently plagiarize material. Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to meticulously cite the page numbers of all the information you include in your notes.\n  Save your work. You will need to create a system for organizing and retaining these annotations and notes for later use. You might use a series of organized folders on your computer or some kind of filing system in manila folders. Whatever works best for you.\n  "});index.add({'id':19,'href':'/courses/workshops/','title':"Workshops",'content':"Workshops and Lectures This term we will do a series of workshops designed to learn and practice various skills needed for academic writing and research.\nWriting 2 Altering sources  Annotation  Argument analysis  Argument summary  Sentence variety  Working with sources  Peer Review  Considering audience  Rhetorical analysis  Writing 3  Introduction to Writing 3  This lecture provides a brief introduction to our WR3 course objectives, assignments, and topic.\n  Introduction to Cultural Studies  This lecture provides a brief, wholly reductive introduction to cultural studies.\n  Further (completely optional) reading on cultural studies:  \u0026ldquo;Cultural Studies\u0026rdquo;, by Dan Kagan and  \u0026ldquo;Articulation Theory\u0026rdquo;, by Jennifer Daryl Slack.\n  Music from:  Dyslexic Fudgicle, \u0026ldquo;Planet Hitler\u0026quot;;  Jim Gutherie, \u0026ldquo;Personnel\u0026quot;;  Daniel Birch, \u0026ldquo;Indigo Blocks\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Blue Deeper than Indigo.\u0026rdquo;\n    Introduction to Academic Research  An introduction to academic research and some strategies for success.

In short, rhetoric is a mode of altering reality, not by the direct application of energy to objects, but by the creation of discourse which changes reality through the mediation of thought and action. The rhetor alters reality by bringing into existence a discourse of such a character that the audience, in thought and action, is so engaged that it becomes mediator of change (3-4).\n\u0026mdash; Lloyd F. Bitzer, \u0026ldquo;The Rhetorical Situation\u0026rdquo;\n  Constructing the Audience Everything we write has an audience\u0026mdash;the person or people we address with our words. Even a private journal is addressed to a future version of the writer\u0026rsquo;s current self. To a large degree these audiences will determine what we say and how we say it.\nIt is easy to jump too quickly to the immediate purpose of our writing\u0026mdash;the idea we want to articulate or the viewpoint we hope to convince others to adopt. In doing so we forget that how we say something is as important as what we say, particularly when we address people who don\u0026rsquo;t share our values, culture, or life experiences. The presentation of our argument\u0026mdash;the kinds of evidence we use to support it, the words we choose to articulate it\u0026mdash;must be tailored for our audience if we hope to be successful.\nThe nature of audiences is often elusive and complex. We may never completely understand the character and motives of our audience members; this imperfect knowledge presents a great challenge for writing arguments. Your audience members may hold views or beliefs that, while quite opaque, greatly determine their receptiveness to your message. And in some cases your audience may be completely unknown to you\u0026mdash;for example, if you write for the web. Thus, imagining the audience for your message is often not an easy task; it is something that you will have to make a judgment about using whatever evidence you happen to possess at the time.\nBefore you write anything, carefully analyze those people whom you desire to persuade. To the best of your knowledge, take an inventory of what you know about the audience (or audiences) you plan to address in your writing. This analysis should give you insight into how best to present your thinking, reasoning, and evidence. You might begin an audience analysis by asking questions such as these:\n Who is your audience or audiences? What are their values? What educational background(s) do they have? What political views do they hold? What ideas or commonalities do you share with them? What does your audience already know about the topic you plan to present? What form will your audience expect that your writing will take? (For example, if the writing occurs within a specific academic discipline, your writing will need to adopt to the preferred style for that discipline: MLA, Chicago, APA, etc.)  Questions like these can help us imagine the audience we address in our writing and gain a sense of the rhetorical situation we face. This kind of intelligence will help us make good decisions about many aspects of the writing process such as organization, diction, tone, style, and evidence.\nPersuading the Audience While there are many types of writing, the kind you will do in college is largely concerned with argumentation and persuasion; it is a form of reasoned discourse designed to change the audience\u0026rsquo;s mind or cause them to adopt some new idea or plan of action. As you analyze your audience, imagine how these particular people will respond to the argument(s) you plan to present to them. For example:\n What sorts of constraints do you envision in getting your audience to accept your argument? If your intended audience already has known positions you oppose, how can you work carefully to convince them that their views should change? What sorts of things should you avoid presenting in your message? What common values or beliefs can be used to make your views more appealing and consistent with your audience\u0026rsquo;s outlook? How can you establish rapport with your audience, based on what you know? How can you demonstrate that you are an authority on the issue or problem at hand?  Done properly, an audience analysis will help you craft your argument more effectively, adopt a proper tone, use appropriate vocabulary, and avoid any rhetorical missteps that may alienate your readers.\nAddressing a broad audience In college your audience will most often be your professor and fellow class members. However, when you write you should learn to address a more general audience. This means that you will not take certain things for granted as you write and ensure that you provide good contextual information designed to help your readers gain clear understanding.\nFor example, while your professor knows the authors and readings he or she assigned in the class very well, when you reference them in your writing you should take care to introduce them, thus addressing a more expansive audience who may not be familiar with the texts or authors in question. To illustrate, consider the following two sentences:\nPoor awareness of audience needs 1. As we talked about in class, Freire argues that banking can be undemocratic and oppressive.\n  Explanation: This sentence assumes that the audience knows certain things, namely Paulo Freire, his essay, and class discussions. However, writing the sentence in this way excludes everyone who is not taking part in this particular class. Imagine the confusion you would experience after reading this sentence if you had not taken part in the discussion of this piece of writing. You might wonder: What is \u0026ldquo;banking\u0026rdquo;? You mean my credit card company is oppressing me? Who is this Freire guy? Is he some authority I should trust? Where did he make this argument?  Good awareness of audience needs 2. In an essay entitled \u0026ldquo;The \u0026lsquo;Banking Concept\u0026rsquo; of Education,\u0026rdquo; Brazilian educator Paulo Freire argues that a widely practiced form of schooling that he terms \u0026ldquo;banking education\u0026rdquo; is oppressive and undemocratic.\n  Explanation: The second sentence attempts to include a much larger audience by carefully introducing important context. By providing the author\u0026rsquo;s full name, his profession, the essay title, and the definition of key terms, the audience will feel they are being addressed by the writing, rather than excluded. Further, they will gain important contextual information that is needed for understanding and coherence.  "});index.add({'id':21,'href':'/resources/open-handbook/chapter-4/','title':"The Joy of Reuse (Save Your Work)",'content':"Chapter Four: The Joy of Reuse  Save all your work Most students complete their school work, turn it in to their professor, then never think of it again. These efforts then cross the event horizon into the black hole of a computer hard drive, never to emerge again. If this sounds like your standard practice, consider a change now that you\u0026rsquo;ve arrived at college. When you write something (essays, notes, reports, projects, code), or when you use something (course readings, research, data), keep a copy of it in some organized folder system so you may return to it in the future.\nTaking the time to meticulously save all this work may sound counterintuitive\u0026mdash;the class is over, right? But that essay you wrote freshman year, the notes you took on a scholarly article, the readings you dutifully annotated in your history class, may be very useful to you in some future project that you can\u0026rsquo;t anticipate now. Summarily tossing all of your work into the black hole forces you to start over again and again.\nWhile it is important to save your finished work, it is also critical that you save the research, notes, or data that contributed to that project as well. Try, as best you can, to capture all of the inputs that led to your finished work and save them in some organized way. Successful scholars and students return to prior work and research all the time\u0026mdash;reshaping, repurposing, and extending prior efforts. They understand that knowledge is cumulative: it accretes and deepens over time, often by building on what came before.\nThis is the joy of reuse.\nStaying organized To retain your work and stay organized, you might use a simple paper system made up of manila folders or large 3-ring binders. Or you might use a hierarchical folder system on your computer organized by class, project, or term. Alternatively, you might embrace a powerful bibliographic manager like Zotero. Whatever you choose, create a system for staying organized and stick with it.\nA poor file-saving strategy I assume that most students today will embrace an electronic system to manage their workflows, take notes, and compose texts. Let\u0026rsquo;s imagine two archive systems to store this typical scholarly work. Here is the first, which I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend:\n/ └── My Documents ├── Essay.docx ├── hack-dartmouth.py ├── ideas.docx ├── MyDog_Rex.jpg ├── Nosetalgia.mp3 ├── Notes2.doc ├── Notes.doc ├── Revision.docx └── syllabus.pdf      The strategy represented here breaks down very quickly for two reasons. First, after a few weeks of accumulating notes, readings, research, and other important documents, a system with no hierarchically organized folders becomes a confusing and unhelpful jumble. Secondly, the choices for naming the files actively resist discovery and recognition. What, for example, is the subject of Notes.docx? What class was it from? What lecture? Of the many essays you wrote last term, which one is Essay.docx? And Revision.docx is a revision of what, precisely? A year from now you won\u0026rsquo;t remember, but you may very well care at that time. Unfortunately, the folder into which you\u0026rsquo;ve dumped these files will have swelled to a debilitating size that will disrupt any attempt to make use of your hard work.\nA better file-saving strategy Instead of this haphazard and unhelpful approach, each time you place an artifact in your archive, think about your future self who will want to find something quickly, with minimal effort. An important first step in this process is to adopt some kind of logical foldering structure that quickly reduces the effort of finding a particular item. You should make considered and thoughtful decisions about your archive\u0026rsquo;s structure. Perhaps you will choose to organize your work by year, or term, or class, or project. There are pluses and minuses to any organizational schema, but changing things up later is difficult, so choose wisely.\nPerhaps the most critical step in the construction of your scholarly archive is to adopt a strict naming convention for your folders and files. Keep in mind sociologist Kieran Healy\u0026rsquo;s helpful advice that a \u0026ldquo;file or folder should always be able to tell you what it is\u0026rdquo; (7) without actually having to open it. Taking this sound advice to heart, we might revise the previous filing strategy like this:\n / └── My Documents ├── Courses │ ├── CS1-F20 │ │ └── hack-dartmouth.py │ └── Writing2-F20 │ ├── essay1-draft1-090720.docx │ ├── essay1-draft2-091520.docx │ ├── notes-Freire-110520.docx │ ├── notes-Percy-102820.docx │ ├── workshop2-draft1-101720.docx │ └── WR23-syllabus.pdf ├── Music │ └── Pusha-T-Nosetalgia.mp3 └── Photos └── 2018-MyDogRex.jpg      Your system will obviously become far more complex than the simplified example presented above. You might, for example, want to create subfolders within a class to further organize your files. Or you might elect to organize your folders by year and term. Whatever you decide, the key features of a good filing system are detectable here: 1) there is a logical structure to the organization, using course names and file types to determine the names of the folders and 2) the naming convention for the folders and files tell you exactly what they are without having to open them. There is no right or wrong way to make a filing system, and one size will not fit all. You will have to determine for yourself what system makes sense.\nVery large filing systems Most students will find the simple filing system described above adequate for their needs. But if you have an expectation of a very large file system, or if you plan to share a file system with other researchers, you should consider a slightly different approach. Large collections of files are quite difficult to manage; this is especially true when additional researchers are involved with saving and editing files in the shared directory. Special care in the naming of files and folders is critical here to avoid confusion and lost data.\n While each project is different and will require its own approach, there are two best practices that should be followed in any shared research repository: 1) a plaintext README file in each project directory and 2) a shared naming convention for files and folders, described below.  Using README files for large filing systems A README file is simply a plaintext file that contains general information about a project. It functions like a roadmap that helps other researchers orient themselves to a new project and coordinate their efforts more easily. Information in a README might include some of the following:\n  A short overview of the project.\n  The names and contact information of the researchers.\n  An inventory list of all the data or documents within a directory (with a short description of what they are).\n  If the project involves software: a description of installation, dependencies, how to report bugs, licensing, etc.\n  Descriptions of file versions, if they are revised in some way.\n  If there are multiple subfolders (as in the example below), those folder paths should be clearly indicated to show their location and contents.\n  A dated list of updates to the project as they occur.\n  Suggested naming conventions for files and subfolders.\n  Descriptions of how other interested researchers can join you and your work.\n  Descriptions of possible avenues for future work with the data or project.\n  Example README file     `... /ProjectAlpha/README.md` --- ### RESEARCH PROJECT ALPHA **[Include an short summary of the project here . . .]()** ### Researchers - Jeff Goldbug: [jeff.g.goldbug19@dartmouth.edu]() - Alain Frenchy: [alain.frenchy@stanford.edu]() - Chloe Vinyl-Siding: [chloe.vinyl-siding@gmail.com]() ### Data Inventory [/ProjectAlpha/Data/]() -- 201907-EditData.xlsx (data on edits) -- 201907-EditData.RData (R dataset file) -- 201907-GrantLetter.docx (Letter to rich foundation) -- 201907-Visualization.py (Data visualization program) -- 201910-VisualizationV01.py (Update; bugfix \\#14) -- 201911-VisualizationV02.py (Update; bugfix \\#15) . . . ### Documents [/ProjectAlpha/Docs/]() -- 201910-Bibliography.docx (Project bibliography) -- 201910-Presentation.pptx (Class presentation) ### Updates - 20191012: Updated bibliography entries - 20191028: Update to visualization program - 20191103: Update to visualization program    # --- File-naming advice Avoid using spaces or underscores in the naming of folders, as some computer systems or programs will have difficulty with them.

Please, I beg of you, back up all your data regularly and keep a copy separate from your main working computer. There are heartbreaking stories of people losing years of work in a hard drive failure, theft, or house fire/flood. Very few people are disciplined enough to back up their work regularly on their own initiative; instead, you should embrace some kind of regular, automated system to ensure your work will survive any tragedy.\n  At some point in the future you will boot up your laptop and it will begin smoking, or be infected by ransomware, or display the BSoD. You will have no backups.

Types of College Writing",'content':"Types of College Writing  Most students are trained in high school to write what is known as a five-paragraph essay\u0026mdash;a form of writing containing an introduction, three paragraphs of support, and a summary conclusion. In that it encourages students to think about introductions, structure, organization, paragraphing, evidence, and reasoning, the five-paragraph essay is good training for novice writers. However, this particular rhetorical form is extremely limiting: only certain, rather paltry, thoughts and ideas may be placed within a five paragraph structure.\nYour college coursework will require that you reach for rhetorical forms of an entirely different nature. Little of the thinking you will be challenged to do in college will fit within the constraints of the five-paragraph essay. Big ideas, complex reasoning, and deep inquiry will require more sophisticated structures. Rather than force all of your reasoning and inquiry into a preformulated and supposedly universal structure, you will be asked to embrace the idea that the formal properties of a piece of writing are determined by the particular needs of the argument. Thus, the shape of your reasoning will determine the essay\u0026rsquo;s form. Furthermore, every discipline has its own particular way(s) of writing; as you progress through your coursework you will become more familiar with how your chosen field of study presents its own kind of academic discourse.\nWhile academic writing takes on many forms, the following are the most common modes of writing you will encounter. However, it is perhaps misleading to present these various modes of academic writing as discrete things. Please understand that there are no definite lines between these various kinds of academic writing, and it is uncommon to write in one mode exclusively. The rhetorical tasks you face in college will often require you to combine these modes in various ways within a single piece of writing. For example, an argument paper will often involve synthesis and analysis, a research essay may use one or more theories, and a theory paper might use close reading and analysis.\nArgument An argument paper requires you to make a claim about a debatable issue and then defend that claim using evidence and reasoning. Virtually all academic writing is argumentative in nature. Argumentative essays generally begin with an introduction that explains the context for the argument and the specific issue, problem, or question that the paper will address. Typically, the author of an argument will use the end of the introduction to present a thesis\u0026mdash;the main idea or claim of the essay. However, this is not always the case. For example, one argumentative form known as the exploratory essay replaces the thesis with a question that is used to initiate an inquiry into an issue or problem. Typically, the thesis appears near the end of this kind of essay, as the culmination of a process of reasoning and inquiry.\nResponse A response paper gives you free license to respond to a text without guidance. Rather than a prompt or prescribed approach given to you by a professor, a response paper allows you to engage a text on your own terms and write from your own perspective.\nWhile a response paper allows you to write about something you choose, your effort should not be an impressionistic one where you only talk about your personal feelings\u0026mdash;what you like or dislike about the subject of your response. Rather, you should seek to evaluate and engage the claims and ideas you find in the text or the meanings you discover in the film, artwork, cultural practice or other artifact. Thus, a response is always argumentative in nature in that you will make claims and use reasoning and evidence as support.\nYour response may seek to take issue with some of the thinking or reasoning put forth in the reading. However, a good response doesn\u0026rsquo;t just say \u0026ldquo;I agree with X\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;I disagree with Y.\u0026rdquo; Instead, explicit reasons are stated and explanations are made that challenge or support the writer\u0026rsquo;s ideas. A good response essay might alternatively attempt to forge a connection between two or more texts by demonstrating a relationship between the ideas or arguments involved\u0026mdash;contrasting, comparing, and evaluating the claims or ideas in the texts. For example, how might Author A respond to Author B? How do their views compare? Can their views be reconciled? Is one view superior?\nExposition An expository essay is one in which you report on, define, summarize, clarify and/or explain a concept, process, idea, or text. Expository essays involve several key patterns such as compare and contrast, cause and effect, problem and solution, or definition. The purpose of this kind of writing is to provide information to an audience unfamiliar with the subject or to demonstrate for a professor that you have understood course material.\nSynthesis As the name suggests, synthesis essays emphasize combining and connecting. Your focus in a synthesis essay is to explain to your audience the ways in which two or more arguments or ideas relate to one another.\nRather than try to summarize two or more things separately, a synthesis will attempt to discover the various things that the authors or texts discuss\u0026mdash;the questions, ideas, and arguments they have in common\u0026mdash;then present those things in an organized and meaningful way. Thus, your objective in a synthesis is to bring two or more distinct sources into a relationship by explaining to your reader the various ways in which the sources are in dialogue.\nStudents attempting synthesis for the first time often make the mistake of organizing their essays by source. For example, this student might introduce two authors in her introduction, summarize Author A, summarize Author B, then conclude by noting the broad similarities and differences in the two authors' thinking. This is not synthesis. In a synthesis essay it is generally best to organize your essay by topic or questions at issue rather than by sources.\nTo begin a synthesis, ask yourself the following questions about the readings you plan to synthesize:\n What are the positions, arguments, and ideas that the source materials have in common? Are the authors all concerned about the same problem(s)? Are their arguments similar or do they differ in some respects? What reasoning supports their arguments? Do they offer similar conclusions or are there differences?  Answering these questions exhaustively will help you write an essay that examines the relationship(s) between the various authors' arguments, comparing and contrasting their views.\nAnalysis/Close Reading Analytical writing involves paying close attention to particular elements of a thing and how those discrete elements work together to produce a whole. While analysis always involves breaking things down and meticulously examining the particulars, the ultimate goal of any analysis is to explain what something means or how it works. In the case of literary criticism, for example, you might perform an analysis of a poem and then attempt to explain its meaning to your audience. Rather than quote an outside authority, you will instead provide your interpretation of the text using only the words of the poem itself as evidence. This process is often referred to as \u0026ldquo;close reading.\u0026rdquo; While this process may be performed on a poem or a scene in a novel, a close reading may also be made of a film sequence, a piece of artwork, a photograph, a built structure, a tribal practice, or even a music video or new fashion trend.\nIn more scientific disciplines you might examine a collection of data, then describe in detail how this information leads to a broader explanation, theory, or conclusion. In all cases, the analysis you perform should be used to support a strong thesis\u0026mdash;an idea or that you want your audience to accept as true.\nTheoretical Writing The theoretical essay is one of the most common forms of academic writing. Using a theory is like using a tool: you take it with you to your job of reading and interpreting a text and use it to uncover ideas and shape thoughts. Sometimes people refer to theoretical arguments as \u0026ldquo;lens\u0026rdquo; essays since you view the text(s) you are analyzing through the theory you have chosen. Like a lens, the theory will color the text, bring certain things into focus, and make others fade out of view.\nWe might, for example, use a feminist theory to examine a novel. In this case, the theory would sensitize us to certain aspects of the text such as the power relationships between the female and male characters or how social authorities or institutions treat men and women differently. Alternatively, we might perform a Marxist analysis which would cause us to study how social class and disparities in wealth shape the narrative and the various characters' outcomes in the fictional world they inhabit. But theory is not just for the analysis of fiction. We might, for example, appropriate some economic, sociological, or anthropological theory to analyze how people behave at the mall or use some psychological model to explain the decision to join a fraternity.\nThere is an extraordinary variety of extant theoretical models that may be used for the interpretation of texts, cultural forms, and various kinds of data. In fact, every field of study uses theory in some way\u0026mdash;from literary criticism to the hard sciences. As you begin to specialize within a chosen discipline of study, you will encounter the theoretical models that are important for that discipline.\nResearch A research paper requires you to draw on outside sources in addition to your own thinking in the service of an argument. Research writing often includes many of the kinds of writing described above. Indeed, research writing involves a coordination of all of the previously mentioned skills and rhetorical modes. For example, your research paper may involve one or more theories, perform various kinds of analysis, synthesize the thinking of many other writers or thinkers, and make one or more arguments.\nWhen you make an academic argument, you are often entering a conversation that existed long before you appeared. When you write, you must remain mindful of the conversations that came before and nestle your views within those that already exist. In short, you must demonstrate that your ideas have a context. This is where research comes into play. Before you can responsibly offer your views, you must know what the critical conversation is, what arguments are being made, and what questions are important (or irrelevant) to the debate.\nProperly done, research ensures that what you write is a true contribution to the ongoing discussion, and not a pointless exercise in repetition. The whole point, after all, is to move the scholarly conversation further down the road, not endlessly spin our wheels.\n"});index.add({'id':24,'href':'/resources/open-handbook/chapter-7/','title':"7. Paragraphs and Topic Sentences",'content':"Paragraphs \u0026amp; Topic Sentences   I can remember picking up my father\u0026rsquo;s books before I could read. The words themselves were mostly foreign, but I still remember the exact moment when I first understood, with a sudden clarity, the purpose of a paragraph. I didn\u0026rsquo;t have the vocabulary to say \u0026quot;paragraph,\u0026quot; but I realized that a paragraph was a fence that held words. The words inside a paragraph worked together for a common purpose. They had some specific reason for being inside the same fence.\n\u0026mdash;Sherman Alexie, \u0026ldquo;Superman and Me\u0026rdquo;.\n  A paragraph is a unit of text devoted to developing an idea. The idea is usually stated in a topic sentence. The topic sentence most commonly appears as the paragraph\u0026rsquo;s first sentence; however, in what is known as a periodic paragraph, the topic sentence will appear at the end.\nParagraphs should be unified. Every sentence in the paragraph should focus in some way on the main idea expressed in the topic sentence. Further, the paragraph\u0026rsquo;s individual sentences should be presented in a logical order and flow naturally from one to the other. While this is not a strict rule, it may be helpful to think of paragraphs as miniature essays, each with their own thesis, development, and proof.\nHow can I make my paragraphs unified?   Identify the main idea of the paragraph then remove or revise any sentence that does not develop that main idea or repeats ideas offered in another sentence.\n  Consider the order of your sentences. Is there a reason why they are in the order they are, or do they need to be rearranged to make sense to a reader?\n  Think about employing some transitions at the beginning of some of the sentences. These will help you pinpoint the relationships between your ideas/sentences and thus clarify these relationships for your reader. To help guide your readers in understanding the relationships between the sentences of your paragraphs, you might use words like For example, However, Additionally, Specifically, On the other hand, Obviously, As a result, In distinction to, In other words, Significantly, etc.\n  Repeat key words to remind your audience of the paragraph\u0026rsquo;s focus.\n  Strong topic sentences Topic sentences function like a miniature thesis that communicates the purpose or main idea of a paragraph. It is important that your topic sentences are clear and accurately reflect the nature of the paragraph it initiates.\nMost commonly, topic sentences are strong, declarative statements that make a claim. The sentences that follow the topic sentence in the paragraph are used to support that claim. However, a topic sentence may also be a question. In this case, the sentences that follow the topic sentence are used to move toward a conclusion or further develop the question.\nExample paragraphs This paragraph is part of a larger student essay performing a theoretical analysis of Wes Anderson\u0026rsquo;s 1998 film Rushmore. The essay uses theoretical ideas borrowed from Brazilian educational theorist Paulo Freire. According the the author, the film\u0026rsquo;s central character, Max Fischer, fails to live up to the standards for education that Freire articulates.\nAn incoherent paragraph   Liberation education culminates in an effort to change the world. However, according to Freire, this change must embrace a communitarian philosophy. This is what Max Fischer fails to understand. Max is keen to change the world, shaping it to his needs and wants, but he fails to understand Freire\u0026rsquo;s imperatives on community, dialogue and consensus. The views, ideas, and values held by a community are used to change the world, not one individual\u0026rsquo;s desire. Rather than shape the world with others, Max insists on altering the world for himself alone.\n    The topic sentence of the paragraph does not represent the true nature of the paragraph. The paragraph is about Max\u0026rsquo;s failure to embrace a core idea expressed by Freire; however, the topic sentence suggests the paragraph will only discuss something called \u0026ldquo;liberation education.\u0026rdquo; Further, the paragraph\u0026rsquo;s sentences are not presented in a helpful or logical order.  Revised paragraph   Although Freire argues that liberation education culminates in an effort to change the world, Max Fischer\u0026rsquo;s efforts in this regard fail to embrace the philosophy of community that Freire demands. While Freire beckons us to become \u0026ldquo;transformers of the world\u0026rdquo; (73), he insists that it must only happen after a process of \u0026ldquo;dialogue\u0026rdquo;: an open exchange of ideas between equal partners (78-9). For Freire, these moments of co-inquiry are used to transform the world into a more democratic and free society (86). While Max is keen to change the world, he selfishly shapes it to his own needs and wants, failing to understand Freire\u0026rsquo;s insistence on community, dialogue, and consensus. Rather than shape the world with others, as Freire recommends, Max insists on altering the world for himself alone.\n    This revised paragraph uses the topic sentence to announce that the passage will focus on how Max Fischer fails to live up to a standard expressed by Freire. This new topic sentence reflects the nature of the paragraph much more faithfully. Furthermore, the author arranges the sentences so as to educate the audience about the Freire\u0026rsquo;s theory before using it to criticize the actions of the film\u0026rsquo;s main character, Max Fischer. The result is a more logical and intelligible paragraph.  "});index.add({'id':25,'href':'/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8/','title':"8. Working with Sources",'content':"Working with Sources   The ugly fact is books are made out of books.\n\u0026ndash;Cormac McCarthy\n  Academic writing always involves integrating the thinking of others into your own writing. There are only three ways that the words and ideas of others may appear in your writing: summary, paraphrase, and quotation. Writing an academic paper requires a mastery of all three skills. It is critical to always give credit to the other authors whose ideas or words you borrow. Failing to do so may result in the accusation of plagiarism. The way scholars avoid plagiarism is by using signal phrases and citations.\nUsing signal phrases What are they? Signal phrases are words that tell your readers that you are borrowing text or ideas from a source. The borrowed material could be quoted, summarized, or paraphrased. The signal phrase, as the name suggests, tells your reader that you are about to begin borrowing; after you have presented the borrowed material, the concluding citation tells the reader that the borrowing has concluded. Using signal phrases and citations to bookend your borrowings from other texts helps you avoid plagiarism, organize your writing, and help your readers understand how your views relate to the views of the other writers you present in your writing.\nWhy use them?   They make it clear when you are transitioning from your own ideas and writing to the ideas and writing of others and back again.\n  They make it clear when you have begun to paraphrase or summarize. Unlike quotations, paraphrases and summaries are not formatted with quotation marks; therefore, it is difficult for readers to know when or where you have begun to paraphrase or summarize unless you include signal phrases and citations.\n  They make the tone of your paper more academic and authoritative.\n  They compel you to articulate how your ideas relate to those you have borrowed from others. This will direct your attention to the precise ways in which authors agree or disagree with you or each other, and allow you to make these intersections clear to your reader.\n  Using these signal phrases will help you to avoid plagiarism.\n  How do you construct a signal phrase?   Use the author\u0026rsquo;s name. The first time you mention an author, include the author\u0026rsquo;s full name, the title of his or her work, and perhaps a brief statement indicating the author\u0026rsquo;s credentials. Once you have introduced an author in your paper, only use his or her last name if you mention him or her again.\n  Use a strong verb to characterize what the author has done. The list below has possible selections. Be sure to pick a verb that most precisely describes the author\u0026rsquo;s intent or action. For example:\n   asserts, argues, believes, claims, emphasizes, insists, observes, reports, suggests, acknowledges, admires, agrees, corroborates, endorses, extols, praises, verifies, illustrates, expands on, rejects, complicates, contends, contradicts, denies, disagrees, refutes, questions, warns, proposes, implores, exhorts, demands, calls for, recommends, urges, advocates, wonders, asks, rejects, encourages.\n Example of a signal phrase use Here is an example of a student properly using signal phrases and citations to indicate borrowings from other sources:\nJoe Student\nEnglish 120\nProf. Taylor\nOct. 28, 2012\nOrigins of Taoism: A Fake Essay   A number of scholarly views exist that attempt to explain the nature and origins of Taoist religious practices. In his book The Tao Practice, scholar Rico Burgerton argues that \u0026ldquo;Taoism emerged during a period of unprecedented struggle, deprivation, and suffering in the fourth century BCE\u0026rdquo; (89). This historical condition, he explains, resulted in religious and cultural practices and beliefs that valued asceticism and practiced detachment from desire (12). However, other historians disagree. In his \u0026ldquo;Up and Down of the Tao,\u0026rdquo; Li Chang argues that Taoism as we know it was largely a creation of the 17th-century, a time of relative prosperity, radical socio-political change, and modernization in China (5). According to this view, Taoist asceticism was actually a rejection of this tumultuous cultural transformation\u0026mdash;an expression of nostalgia for a simpler time in the ancient Chinese past (22). But which is the correct answer? Did Taoism emerge in a time of poverty or a time of plenty? In my view, both views are problematic . . .   \n Notice here how the author of this paragraph uses signal phrases and citations to distinguish his voice from the two source texts he is using. The student announces that he is borrowing words or ideas (in the form of quotations, summary, or paraphrase) with a signal phrase and the author\u0026rsquo;s name, then bookends the borrowing with a citation. The paragraph concludes with the student transitioning from the source texts to his own thoughts, posing a series of questions that he will try to answer in the reminder of the paper. The moves on display here are the foundational building blocks of all academic writing. This is one of the more important skills to master for success in academic writing contexts.\nWe can represent this important tactic with the following formula:\n Signal phrase + borrowed text/idea + citation.  Quotation When should I quote something? Quotation is the inclusion of another author\u0026rsquo;s exact wording in your own writing. While quotation is a critical element of all academic writing, you must be judicious in its use. Only quote when the rhetorical situation requires it. The overuse of quotation can make you appear lazy or lacking in confidence. That said, there are moments when quotations are entirely justified and useful. For example:\n  When you are interpreting literature such as a poem or novel, the specific language used in the text is the subject of your essay. That is to say, your argument is about the meaning of the exact words chosen by the author for his or her literary work. It is critical in these instances to use quotations from the literary text and then explain what those words mean to your audience\u0026mdash;a process known as \u0026quot;close reading\u0026quot; in literary studies.\n  When you are making an argument it is often helpful to use the words of known authorities to help make your case. While you may not be a doctor, physicist, or professional journalist, you may use their words and arguments to help give credibility to your ideas. While using the exact words of these important authorities can be rhetorically effective, make sure to use them prudently. If your essay becomes a mere tissue of quotation, your authority as an author is undermined. The strongest voice in your essay should be your own. Allow these other voices to be briefly heard; don\u0026rsquo;t allow them to drown out your own voice.\n  When the source text contains language that is memorable, beautiful, or particularly apt, quotation is justified. If you feel that summarizing or paraphrasing would do violence to the original language, using a quotation is often the best choice.\n  A quotation is often necessary when you describe legal discourse (such as a law or court ruling) where words cannot be paraphrased or summarized without altering the meaning and effect of the legal language.\n  For most other circumstances, summary or paraphrase of the original language is best.\nHow do I integrate quoted material?   Use a signal phrase to introduce the quoted passage.\n  Use quotation marks.\n  Provide a citation in your chosen format, such as MLA or Chicago.\n  If necessary, use ellipsis or brackets to alter the source, satisfy grammar, or provide clarifying information.\n  What should I avoid?   Avoid excessive use of quotation. If you quote too often it can make it appear that you have not fully read or understood the source material. It may also make your writing appear lazy and thoughtless.\n  Avoid excessive use of block quotation. Block quotations should be rare; reserve them for special language that you believe cannot be summarized or paraphrased. Try instead to use a mixture of quotation, paraphrase, and selective quotation to integrate the source material into your writing.\n  Avoid inserting a quote within your writing without providing your commentary or explanation. Explain to your audience what your quotes mean and connect them to your broader argument so that the reader will understand how to interpret them.\n  Avoid inserting quotations without signal phrases. Quotations should be introduced and woven into your own writing. They should rarely stand alone.\n  Example of a quotation Let\u0026rsquo;s imagine that the following is the source text that you would like to quote in your own writing:\n    At the heart of the environmentalist worldview is the conviction that human physical and spiritual health depends on sustaining the planet in a relatively unaltered state. Earth is our home in the full, genetic sense, where humanity and its ancestors existed for all the millions of years of their evolution. Natural ecosystems\u0026mdash;forests, coral reefs, marine blue waters\u0026mdash;maintain the world exactly as we would wish it to be maintained. Our body and our mind evolved precisely to live in this particular planetary environment and no other. When we debase the global environment and extinguish the variety of life, we are dismantling a support system that is too complex to understand, let alone replace, in the foreseeable future (238).\n\u0026ndash; E.O. Wilson, \u0026ldquo;Is Humanity Suicidal?\u0026rdquo;   \nSample quotations from the source text:   In a recent essay, scientist E.O. Wilson considers a dark truth about humanity: \u0026ldquo;we are dismantling a support system that is too complex to understand, let alone replace, in the foreseeable future\u0026rdquo; (238).\n  \u0026ldquo;At the heart of the environmentalist worldview,\u0026rdquo; claims scientist E.O. Wilson, \u0026ldquo;is the conviction that human physical and spiritual health depends on sustaining the planet in a relatively unaltered state\u0026rdquo; (238).\n  One important biologist insists that if we \u0026ldquo;debase\u0026rdquo; the planet we risk \u0026ldquo;dismantling a support system\u0026rdquo; that is too complicated to understand or replace (Wilson 238).\n  What if the original quotation has an error? Occasionally you will want to quote a text that contains an error of some sort. Perhaps the author used the wrong word or there is a misspelling or grammatical error. In these cases, you may want to indicate to your readers that the error exists in the original text and is not a sloppy accident of your own making. To communicate this to your readers, use the Latin term sic, or \u0026ldquo;thus,\u0026rdquo; next to the offending word or error. For example:\n According to the report, \u0026ldquo;The children were told to make there [sic] beds\u0026rdquo; (98).  How do I quote someone else\u0026rsquo;s quotation? Occasionally you will discover a quotation in someone’s writing that you would like to use in your own writing. These are known as indirect quotations. How do you cite that?\nLet’s look at an example. Imagine that you discover the following paragraph on page 77 of a scholarly article written by John Mackey:\n Chimene Keitner discusses the question of the rule of law within the novel Ramona, arguing that this text “illustrates the tensions and misunderstandings that can arise when people from different communities find themselves in situations of jurisdictional overlap” (54). She maintains that the fact that the Señora views the Land Commission’s takings of her property as “theft” is indicative that at least two distinct understandings of the rule of law are operating (57).\n MLA If you want to borrow the Chimene Keitner quotation, you would write the following:\n Scholar Chimene Keitner persuasively argues that the Señora’s plight demonstrates the “tensions and misunderstandings that can arise when people from different communities find themselves in situations of jurisdictional overlap” (qtd. in Mackey 77).\n  Place John Mackey’s article in your bibliography, not Keitner’s.  Chicago Here is the corresponding Chicago form for indirect quotations:\n Scholar Chimene Keitner persuasively argues that the Señora’s plight demonstrates the “tensions and misunderstandings that can arise when people from different communities find themselves in situations of jurisdictional overlap.” ³\n  In your notes page, give the author and publication information of the source quoted followed by the source where you found the quote. For example:  3. Chimene Keitner, “The Challenge of Building Inter-Communal Rule of Law in Helen Hunt Jackson’s Ramona,” Law and Literature, 15, no. 1 (2003): 54, quoted in John Mackey, The California Novel (Boston: Stone and Branch Books, 2012), 77. Summary In a summary you present the ideas of another writer in a condensed form. The length of a summary is dictated by your rhetorical needs, but they are always shorter than the original text. For example, the summary of a large book could be 20 pages, one paragraph, or one sentence. Although a summary sacrifices specificity and detail in the interest of brevity, it must always remain a faithful representation of the original text.\nWhy are summaries important? Summary is one of the central skills needed for academic writing. Summary often appears in an academic essay\u0026rsquo;s introductory section(s) to provide readers with background information or historical context. It is also used to explain complex scholarly conversations that the writer plans to engage with his or her essay. An excellent summary of this broader scholarly conversation goes far to establish you as a knowledgeable authority with your readers\u0026mdash;someone whose views should be trusted and considered. Summary is particularly useful when we make use of secondary sources in our writing. If we want to use or introduce another source in our own writing, we use summary to inform our audience about the arguments and ideas contained within it in an abbreviated form. We also make significant use of summary in the complex work of synthesis, where we explain how two or more texts relate to one another.\nHow do I incorporate summaries?  Since summaries do not use quotation marks, you must take care to indicate to your readers that you are borrowing from the work of others. This is primarily accomplished through the use of a signal phrase and a citation. Think of the signal phrase and the citation as a way to bookend a borrowing from a source. The signal phrase alerts readers that you are about to borrow from another text; the citation is used to show that the borrowing has concluded. An appropriate citation always notes the page(s) summarized.  What should I avoid?  Avoid plagiarizing. Remember, summarized material is still borrowed material, even though you have greatly condensed it and put it entirely in your own words. Make sure that any summarized material is introduced with a signal phrase and concluded with a citation.  Example of a summary Let\u0026rsquo;s imagine that the following is the source text that you would like to summarize in your own writing:\n    When academic territories were parceled out in the early twentieth century, anthropology got the tellers of tales and history got the keepers of written records. As anthropology and history diverged, human differences that hinged on literacy assumed an undeserved significance. Working with oral, preindustrial, prestate societies, anthropologists acknowledged the power of culture and of a received worldview; they knew that the folk conception of the world was not narrowly tied to proof and evidence. But with the disciplinary boundary overdrawn, it was easy for historians to assume that literacy, the modern state, and the commercial world had produced a different sort of creature entirely\u0026mdash;humans less inclined to put myth over reality, more inclined to measure their beliefs by the standard of accuracy and practicality. (35)\nPatricia Nelson Limerick, The Legacy of Conquest.\n   Sample summary from the source text:  As Patricia Nelson Limerick argues in The Legacy of Conquest, historians have falsely assumed that literate societies with vibrant economies and systems of governance were never beholden to myth or superstition (35).  Paraphrasing Think of paraphrase as a translation from English into English. It involves taking language from a source, putting it into your own words, and arranging it within your own original sentence structure(s). Unlike summary, which aims to reduce or distill an idea, a paraphrase should be similar in length to the original passage.\nWhy are paraphrases important? Accurate paraphrase demonstrates mastery of your source materials and indicates an author who is in control of his or her own writing and thinking. Whereas excessive quotation may reveal an uncertain or tentative author, paraphrase demonstrates control and confidence. However, ensure that your paraphrases do justice to the original, or risk compromising your authority with your readers.\nHow do I incorporate paraphrases?   Like summaries, paraphrases do not use quotation marks. As a result, you must take care to indicate to your readers that you are borrowing from the work of others with a signal phrase and citation. As you move from your own writing to the paraphrase of others, use a signal phrase to indicate this transition.\n  End the paraphrase with an appropriate citation.\n  What should I avoid?   Avoid plagiarizing. Remember, paraphrased material is still borrowed material, even though you have put it in your own words. Make sure that any paraphrased material is introduced with a signal phrase and concluded with a citation.\n  Avoid patchwriting. patchwriting is a process of merely changing a word or a phrase here or there from the original text and presenting the result as your own writing. Instead, ensure that you use your own words and sentence structure in your paraphrase.\n  Example of a paraphrase Let\u0026rsquo;s imagine that the following is the source text that you would like to paraphrase in your own writing:\n    When academic territories were parceled out in the early twentieth century, anthropology got the tellers of tales and history got the keepers of written records. As anthropology and history diverged, human differences that hinged on literacy assumed an undeserved significance.

(35)\nPatricia Nelson Limerick, The Legacy of Conquest.\n    Sample paraphrase from the source text:  In The Legacy of Conquest, Patricia Nelson Limerick argues that during the early part of the last century the disciplines of anthropology and history went their separate ways. While anthropology focused on unlettered and illiterate communities, history became the study of societies who produced texts and records. Within the field of anthropology, a firm belief developed that oral cultures were characterized by mythological worldviews and superstitious beliefs; on the other hand, historians improperly assumed that literate cultures were filled with individuals who only used reason and evidence to guide their thinking (35).

Plagiarism",'content':"Plagiarism   Perish those who said our good things before we did.\n\u0026ndash;Aelius Donatus\n  Definition of plagiarism In the Academic Honor Principle, Dartmouth College defines plagiarism as\n the submission or presentation of work, in any form, that is not a student\u0026rsquo;s own, without acknowledgment of the source. With specific regard to papers, a simple rule dictates when it is necessary to acknowledge sources. If a student obtains information or ideas from an outside source, that source must be acknowledged. Another rule to follow is that any direct quotation must be placed in quotation marks, and the source immediately cited. Students are responsible for the information concerning plagiarism found in Sources and Citations at Dartmouth College.\n Consult the Academic Honor Principle for more information on academic dishonesty and a description of its severe consequences.\nExamples of plagiarism While plagiarism appears in many forms and degrees, we may broadly classify them in three categories:\n  the wholesale copying of another\u0026rsquo;s essay or project\n  the adoption of certain phrases or words from another text without proper attribution (also known as \u0026ldquo;patchwriting\u0026rdquo;)\n  the paraphrase of another\u0026rsquo;s writing without proper attribution or citation.\n  Below you will find examples of these three categories of plagiarism, each one using a passage from Patricia Nelson Limerick\u0026rsquo;s 1987 book, The Legacy of Conquest:\n    When academic territories were parceled out in the early twentieth century, anthropology got the tellers of tales and history got the keepers of written records. As anthropology and history diverged, human differences that hinged on literacy assumed an undeserved significance. Working with oral, preindustrial, prestate societies, anthropologists acknowledged the power of culture and of a received worldview; they knew that the folk conception of the world was not narrowly tied to proof and evidence. But with the disciplinary boundary overdrawn, it was easy for historians to assume that literacy, the modern state, and the commercial world had produced a different sort of creature entirely\u0026mdash;humans less inclined to put myth over reality, more inclined to measure their beliefs by the standard of accuracy and practicality. (35)\nPatricia Nelson Limerick, The Legacy of Conquest.\n    Word-for-word copying Word-for-word copying, such as the following example, is completely unacceptable whether it occurs by mistake or design. Care must be taken when taking notes and typing quotations to avoid representing the words of other authors as your own:\n As we all know, when academic territories were parceled out in the early twentieth century, anthropology got the tellers of tales and history got the keepers of written records. This made historians assume that literacy, the modern state, and the commercial world had produced a different sort of creature entirely\u0026mdash;humans less inclined to put myth over reality, more inclined to measure their beliefs by the standard of accuracy and practicality.\n  This passage fails to use quotation marks to indicate borrowed language. It additionally fails to cite the source of the borrowed language.  Patchwriting This form of plagiarism is often the result of sloppiness in the note-taking or drafting process. Using patches of a source text is perfectly reasonable; however, make sure that quotation marks are used and citations are given:\n When the academic territories were parceled out in the early 1900s, the disciplines diverged. This made the differences that human beings had with regard to literacy assume an undeserved significance. By overdrawing this disciplinary boundary, historians began to believe that the subjects they studied were less inclined to put myth over reality and more likely to measure their beliefs through the excellent standards of accuracy and practicality (Limerick 35).\n  While this student does acknowledge the source she is borrowing from, she fails to enclose words and phrases that come directly from the text.  Paraphrase without attribution The following paraphrase would be perfectly acceptable were it to have a signal phrase and a citation indicating that the ideas were taken from another author\u0026rsquo;s work. Even though no language was taken directly from the source text, the ideas must be attributed to the author from whom they were borrowed. As it stands now, the author is declaring that he came up with these ideas and arguments himself:\n During the early part of the last century the disciplines of anthropology and history separated. While anthropology focused on unlettered and illiterate communities, history became the study of societies who produced texts and records. Within the field of anthropology, a firm belief developed that oral cultures were characterized by mythological worldviews and superstitious beliefs; on the other hand, historians assumed that literate cultures were filled with individuals who only used reason and evidence to guide their thinking.\n  This is an excellent paraphrase of the text. But it is still plagiarism unless you cite it appropriately.  "});index.add({'id':27,'href':'/resources/open-handbook/chapter-9/','title':"9. Altering Sources",'content':"Altering Sources  In your life as a writer you will frequently encounter situations where you must alter a source quotation in some way. Generally, these alterations are used to satisfy grammar or make your writing easier to follow by removing or adding words or phrases.\n  To indicate that we have removed words from a source text we use ellipses . . . a series of periods to mark where something has been removed from the source.\n  To indicate that we have altered or added words to a source text in our own writing we use square brackets: [ ].\n  These alterations should be used sparingly. In fact, you should only alter a source if there is no other practical way to include the material in a quotation. Overuse of brackets or ellipsis will make your writing appear artless and lazy. However, when altering a source proves an indispensable path to crafting readable prose, brackets and ellipsis are helpful tools.\nBe careful that the quote you present to the reader is an accurate reflection of the original text; it is improper to alter a text so that it says something the author did not really intend.\nEllipsis . . . We use ellipses to show when we have altered a source text by omitting words, sentences, or paragraphs. However, be careful that the quote you present to the reader is an accurate reflection of the original text.\nHow do I use ellipsis? [Source Text]\n At the heart of the environmentalist worldview is the conviction that human physical and spiritual health depends on sustaining the planet in a relatively unaltered state. Earth is our home in the full, genetic sense, where humanity and its ancestors existed for all the millions of years of their evolution. Natural ecosystems\u0026mdash;forests, coral reefs, marine blue waters\u0026mdash;maintain the world exactly as we would wish it to be maintained. Our body and our mind evolved precisely to live in this particular planetary environment and no other. When we debase the global environment and extinguish the variety of life, we are dismantling a support system that is too complex to understand, let alone replace, in the foreseeable future (238).\n\u0026ndash; E.O. Wilson, \u0026ldquo;Is Humanity Suicidal?\u0026rdquo;   \n   Omission in the middle of a sentence:\n Wilson argues that \u0026ldquo;Natural ecosystems . . . maintain the world exactly as we would wish it to be maintained\u0026rdquo; (50).\n   Omission of the ending of one sentence and the beginning of another:\n As Wilson states, \u0026ldquo;At the heart of the environmentalist worldview is the conviction that human physical and spiritual health depends on sustaining the planet . . . . where humanity and its ancestors existed for all the millions of years of their evolution\u0026rdquo; (50).\n   Omission of one or more sentences:\n Wilson says that \u0026ldquo;At the heart of the environmentalist worldview is the conviction that human physical and spiritual health depends on sustaining the planet in a relatively unaltered state. . . . When we debase the global environment and extinguish the variety of life, we are dismantling a support system that is too complex to understand, let alone replace, in the foreseeable future\u0026rdquo; (50).\n   Special considerations with ellipsis   Omission at the beginning of a sentence:\nIt is often unnecessary to use ellipsis when you have omitted the beginning of a sentence. Since the portion of the quote you present will begin with a lower case letter, it will be obvious to the reader that it does not begin the sentence in the original text. Thus, for the most part, ellipsis will only occur in the middle or the end of a sentence. Consider the following examples; only example c requires the use of ellipsis to begin a quote:\na) With bracket:\n \u0026ldquo;[H]uman physical and spiritual health,\u0026rdquo; Wilson writes, \u0026ldquo;depends on sustaining the planet in a relatively unaltered state\u0026rdquo; (50).\n b) Lowercase letter:\n According to Wilson, \u0026ldquo;human physical and spiritual health depends on sustaining the planet in a relatively unaltered state\u0026rdquo; (50).\n c) Proper noun in the original:\n As Terrance Smith relates, \u0026ldquo;. . . Wilson argues that we must protect the planet if we want to protect ourselves\u0026rdquo; (99).\n Since \u0026ldquo;Wilson\u0026rdquo; is a proper noun, it is capitalized. This may lead the reader to falsely assume that it is the beginning of a sentence in the original text. Therefore, ellipsis is used to clarify that the original sentence begins earlier.\n  Using a short phrase or word:\nWhen quoting a short phrase or single word there is no need to use ellipsis since it will be clear to your readers that this has been taken from a longer sentence:\n Wilson describes Earth as \u0026ldquo;our home\u0026rdquo; (50).\n   [Brackets]  How do I use brackets? Square brackets are used to indicate an alteration or addition to a source text. Generally, you will use brackets in three circumstances: 1) to add clarifying information, 2) to alter a word in the interest of grammar, or 3) to alter capitalization. A few examples:\n  James McMinnis maintains that \u0026ldquo;the city [Los Angeles] is one of the most horrific places on the face of the earth\u0026rdquo; (88).\n  Dillard concludes her essay by saying that she \u0026ldquo;think[s] it would be well, and proper, and obedient, and pure, to grasp your one necessity and not let it go\u0026rdquo; (34).\n  \u0026ldquo;[H]uman physical and spiritual health,\u0026rdquo; Wilson writes, \u0026ldquo;depends on sustaining the planet in a relatively unaltered state\u0026rdquo; (50).\n  "});index.add({'id':28,'href':'/resources/FAQs/','title':"+ FAQs",'content':"   Course FAQs 1. May I email you my essay for extra comments?   No.  I always give each essay draft a full set of written comments. And I\u0026rsquo;m committed to meet with any student who would like to go over them as many times as necessary. However, I usually do not take requests for extra comments via email unless there is no other possible way a student can meet with me in an office hour or at some other scheduled time. Considering how easy it is to attach a file to an email, almost every student would seek this additional help. As a result, I would be deluged with requests for help, often at the very last minute, making it impossible for me to thoughtfully respond to them all.\n I am happy to discuss your work during office hours or at other times by appointment.    2. May bring my laptop to our office meeting?   Grumble, grumble\u0026hellip;ok.  I have softened on this a bit over the years, mostly because students always ignore my request that they bring a hard copy to my office. Also there is the crushing guilt I feel every time I walk by a tree and think of the toll this policy has had on the natural world.\nIn the past I\u0026rsquo;ve said no to this question because I found that students who bring laptops to my office often type the words that I say directly into their laptops. This potentially blurs the line between critique and authorship. Since it is important that you do your own work, it is best to avoid this problem/temptation by using a hard copy. But if you can avoid this temptation, I\u0026rsquo;m ok with your fancy technology.\n  3. I can\u0026#39;t make office hours; can we meet another time?   Yes!  I will be happy to accommodate students whose schedules conflict with my office hours. Contact me and we can work out the details. If we are unable to find a time that works for both of us, RWIT is another excellent option.   4. May I have an extension?   Sort of.  Sometimes life intervenes in our plans and rudely sets us back. If you get hit by a bus or contract ebola, asking for a paper extension is a reasonable request. But generally it is a bad idea to request an extension unless you find yourself in a similarly extreme situation. Many faculty are reluctant to give extensions because of a duty to the principle of fairness: if one student is granted an extension, the other students who turned their work in on time are disadvantaged. Of course, if you have a serious emergency that prevents you from completing work, I will be happy to work out a new due date.   5. How many times can I bring my paper to you?   As many as you like. But\u0026hellip;  Your professors want to help you. Really, they do. But at some point, seeking help becomes a form of dependence. Taken to extremes, your help-seeking becomes an avoidance of your own responsibility as a writer, a thinker, a student, a human.\nOver the years I have had many students who bring their work to me excessively and want my approval on every edit of their written work. The students who do this just want to do well, but consider what they lose in the bargain. At some point the essay or project ceases to be the work of the student, as the line between authorship and critique first blurs and then becomes indistinguishable. The student has completely surrendered their right to think and know and argue on their own terms, blithely giving away their freedom to an authority figure in the person of their teacher.\nCollege should be a series of experiences through which you gain ownership over your own thinking and define for yourself your ideas and values and meanings. While your teachers are here to provide feedback, critique, and assistance, you should do your own work, think your own thoughts, write your own papers, and, through those experiences, become who you are.\n  6. Why aren\u0026#39;t you grading me? I want to know how well I\u0026#39;m doing.   Consider why you want this\u0026hellip;    If I told you what I thought your work was worth, would that be the right answer?\n  What does it say about you that you need me to tell you what your efforts amount to?\n  How hard did you work? Do you think you improved? What did you learn? What is the value of those things to you?\n  Has seeking a good grade ever made you compromise some belief that you held, however small?\n  Has seeking a good grade ever made your relationship with a teacher less honest and sincere?\n    7.

"});index.add({'id':29,'href':'/resources/open-handbook/chapter-12/','title':"Academic Research",'content':"Academic Research  You are right to be wary. There is much bullshit. Be wary of me too, because I may be wrong. Make up your own mind after you evaluate all the evidence and logic.\n\u0026mdash;Mark Rippetoe\n  Research writing involves a number of important skills: library research, critical thinking, the evaluation of sources, and the ability to synthesize information through summary, paraphrase, and quotation. Although synthesizing the thinking of others is an important part of the research essay, in its true form the research essay strives for much more than a mere restatement of what others have said on a particular topic or question. As Jack Baker and Allen Brizee state:\n A research paper is not simply an informed summary of a topic by means of primary and secondary sources. It is neither a book report nor an opinion piece nor an expository essay consisting solely of one\u0026rsquo;s interpretation of a text nor an overview of a particular topic. Instead, it is a genre that requires one to spend time investigating and evaluating sources with the intent to offer interpretations of the texts, and not unconscious regurgitations of those sources. The goal of a research paper is not to inform the reader what others have to say about a topic, but to draw on what others have to say about a topic and engage the sources in order to thoughtfully offer a unique perspective on the issue at hand.\n In high school you were perhaps asked to write research papers on predetermined topics. These essays were probably not what Baker and Brizee have in mind. Your projects were likely just reports\u0026mdash;retellings of what other scholars or writers have said on a topic. A true research essay involves blazing a new path of inquiry where you produce original ideas, questions, and arguments. A research paper is a contribution to an ongoing conversation, a moment when you engage in dialogue with other important voices about a topic that you value.\nThe Academic Conversation It is helpful to imagine a research essay as taking part in an ongoing conversation. Unlike the dialogue that we have with most people in our lives, these scholarly conversations occur in print\u0026mdash;within published, peer-reviewed books and journal articles. Some conversations are vibrant, with hundreds or even thousands of participants. Other conversations are small, involving but a few specialists. Many conversations have been going on for hundreds or even thousands of years, while other conversations have only just started. Virtually everything you might write or think about is already part of one or more of these conversations. So, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t know it at the time, when you write about anything you are entering a conversation that already exists.\nLike any good conversationalist, the author of a research paper wants to contribute his or her thoughts and opinions for the consideration of others in the conversation. But if you want to be taken seriously in the conversation, you have to know what the debates are about, who is involved in the dialogue, and what has been said previously. In short, you must remain mindful that your ideas have a context. This is why research is important: it is how you come to understand what has already been said and by whom.\nThe moves you make in these conversations will take many forms. We might, for example, take the idea of one scholar and build on it in some way\u0026mdash;perhaps by extending it to a new context. Or, we might offer a new interpretation of the meaning of a particular film, historical event, or scientific experiment, distinguishing our view from the ones that already exist. During this process of articulating our own views, we often find ourselves in conflict with the thinking of others. As a result, we will often contribute to the conversation by expressing the reasons why we disagree in part or in whole with one or more of the other individuals in the conversation. On the other hand, we may also choose to bring in some ideas or words from others that we find helpful in making our own case. But, critically, our writing should never be a mere rehashing of someone else\u0026rsquo;s work. In any case, we must remain mindful that the conversation we hope to take part in existed before we entered it, and that whatever we might say or argue has a context that must be considered. Thus, every academic paper you write will not only argue an original point or idea, it will also show how that idea emerges from an existing conversation.\nThe Research Topic Discovering your own research topic can be an overwhelming experience. With so many things to choose from, finding a narrow focus is often difficult. However, before you can truly begin your library research you need to find a way to narrow your field of inquiry to a small set of research questions or problems.\nAt the outset your research questions will be rather general and mundane. But that is perfectly normal: we all have to start somewhere. Once you have a general topic of interest, however, you can move into a more rigorous research phase.\nAs you begin your research, try to keep an open mind and allow yourself to be pulled in new directions. It is important to think of the research process as something more than a mere attempt to find information on a predetermined topic or an effort to find evidence that supports an idea or belief that one already holds, an error commonly referred to as confirmation bias. Instead, research should be process of discovery where you encounter ideas and contemplate questions that you would have otherwise never imagined. Research, done properly, has the power to change us\u0026mdash;altering our views, values, and sense of things. But you must first allow yourself to become vulnerable to new ideas. During any particular research project you should be prepared to change your mind and your focus many, many times. You will frequently encounter dead ends; but you will also experience the thrill of serendipitous discovery that will take you down a path you would have never considered.\n One important thing to note here is to not confuse a research topic with a research question. The research topic is just a general field of inquiry, a subject that you want to begin exploring. This stage of early research is designed to provoke a specific question or problem that you want to explore in more depth.  Finding A Research Topic Exploring Topics with Subject Searches If you are having difficulty finding a narrow topic of interest, one way to get started is to examine an organized list of every subtopic that is related to your subject of inquiry. Since the Library of Congress assigns a series of subject headings to every published book, you can easily browse a meticulously categorized list of books that relate to your broader research subject. For example, if you want to write an essay on the nation of Iraq, you can perform a subject search with the search term \u0026ldquo;Iraq.\u0026rdquo; The result will be an alphabetized list of every subject that scholars have written on about Iraq\u0026mdash;from agriculture to zoology. So, if you haven\u0026rsquo;t yet found a narrow focus for your project, you can use the subject headings to \u0026ldquo;shop\u0026rdquo; for a subject that interests you.\nFinding Additional Sources through Subject Searches Subject searches are also a helpful means of finding additional sources on your topic once you have acquired one or more. For example, if you discover that historian Alan Taylor\u0026rsquo;s book The Civil War of 1812 is an important source for your research project, you can use the book\u0026rsquo;s subject headings to find all of the other books written on those topics. As you may see from this example, the Library of Congress assigned the book the following three subject headings:\n    1. United States--History--War of 1812--Social aspects\n  2. Ontario--History--War of 1812--Social aspects\n  3. Northern boundary of the United States--History--19th century\n  In most library catalogs these subject headings are hyperlinked; clicking on any of them leads you to a list of every other book in the library that shares that particular subject heading. Thus, if your research interest is the social aspects of the War of 1812, you can quickly find every other book the library owns on that subject with a subject search.\nThough Dartmouth\u0026rsquo;s library holdings are not nearly as large as the Library of Congress, you can perform subject searches by selecting the advanced search feature of the library catalog.\nFinding Background Information A research project should always begin with the reading of general background information about the topic. Before you can ask an intelligent question about your topic or contribute to an ongoing scholarly conversation, you need to develop a working knowledge of basic facts to serve as a foundation for your project. The best way to develop this basic understanding is to examine peer-reviewed reference works such as encyclopedias, dictionaries, and other forms of reference material.\nBaker-Berry library has a number of helpful reference resources in this regard. If you visit the Library Reference Resources link in the Library\u0026rsquo;s Research Guides, you will find an impressive array of organized reference materials like bibliographies, encyclopedias, and dictionaries. Most of them are fully digitized and do not even require a trip to the library. Always start your research project with reference works and gain a basic grounding of your topic before developing your research question or thesis. For example, before you begin an essay on Iraqi feminism in the 1960s, you should read the wikipedia article on the modern history of Iraq to get a broad sense of the context you are entering with your writing. Other helpful background information aids of note:\n Wikipedia, CIA World Factbook, Oxford Reference Online, Britannica Online.  A word of warning about Wikipedia (and internet sources in general): it has not been through a process of peer-review. For that reason, it is unwise to rely on Wikipedia as a source for a research project. Use Wikipedia to gain background information on your topic and lead you to other authoritative sources, but when it comes time to write your essay, use a peer-reviewed source.\nResearch Guides Perhaps the single best aid for research at Dartmouth is the Research Guide. Various subject librarians maintain research guides for every discipline. These guides contain links to subject-specific reference materials (such as encyclopedias and dictionaries), appropriate peer-reviewed journals, electronic databases, biographies, e-texts, book reviews, and a variety of other helpful resources and tips. These guides should be your first stop on a research project and will be an indispensable resource for discovering sources on your chosen topic. These guides are rather uneven. Some are quite excellent; others are rather skimpy.\nSearching for Books When you want to search for books that Dartmouth library owns or can access electronically, use the Library Catalog. Dartmouth also offers a more robust search tool known as Primo. Primo provides you with an experience similar to Google; search terms are applied not only to physical holdings, like books and media, but to electronic databases and journals as well.\nPrimo is used as the backend for the search field on the library\u0026rsquo;s front page. After you submit your search term in the field, you will be presented with a list of books, articles, databases, audio \u0026amp; video, associated digital content, or research aids. These items are organized by relevance, as determined by an algorithm. After entering your search you will notice ways to further refine your search by clicking on several options on the left pane of the window. You might, for example, select for peer-reviewed content, limit your search to books/articles, or ensure that you only see content accessible through our library.\n🔴️ WARNING about Primo  A word of caution about Primo: while it searches the library catalog it its entirety, it does not search all of the electronic databases to which Dartmouth has a subscription. This means that if you exclusively use Primo for your searches, you will miss out on potentially vast amounts of possible sources that could be discovered through searching the various databases individually.   Searching for Periodicals/Articles Periodicals are publications that are published at regular intervals, such as scholarly journals, magazines, and newspapers. Examining periodicals\u0026mdash;especially academic journals\u0026mdash;is an important aspect of research. Since books often take a year or more to go through the process of peer review, editing, typesetting, and printing before they become available for purchase, they often do not contain the most current information. Articles, on the other hand, appear in a far shorter period of time and generally contain the most up-to-date research. For that reason, you should perform a review of journal articles on your research topic to ensure that you are aware of recent discoveries, arguments, and debates within the academic community who share your research focus.\nHowever, a common problem for undergraduate researchers is not knowing which databases or journals are appropriate to search for information on a particular topic. Unless you are a professional scholar, it is difficult to know what the leading journals are in a particular field of study. This is also a problem for faculty performing research outside of their area of expertise. For example, an English professor would know that the academic journal PMLA or the database JSTOR are excellent places to look for articles on Herman Melville\u0026rsquo;s novel Moby Dick, but the novice researcher wouldn\u0026rsquo;t know where to begin. You might also think that a database called \u0026ldquo;Web of Science\u0026rdquo; would be a terrible place to look for articles on a work of literature. You\u0026rsquo;d be wrong.\nTo resolve this problem, our library has organized periodical databases by discipline in the Database Finder. This is designed to help you locate the specific journals, periodical databases, and reference materials that are appropriate for each discipline or research subject. These are an indispensable resource for discovering peer-reviewed sources on your chosen topic.\nYou may also browse alphabetically if you know the name of the database you are looking for.\nSearching with Precision While most students have some familiarity with searching through the Google search engine, library catalogs and databases don\u0026rsquo;t always work in the same way. To query databases effectively and efficiently, you need to be familiar with Boolean searches.\nPerhaps the common research problem is searches that produce too many results. Rather than page through hundreds or thousands of search results, you can use Boolean search strings to make your searches more precise. Boolean searches use what are known as logical operators to form search strings.\nThe three most common logical operators are AND, OR, and NOT. However, you should also learn how to use exact phrases, truncation, and wildcards in search strings.\n    Operator Purpose Example     AND Narrow a search by adding additional keywords Tom Hardy AND shirtless   OR Broaden a search by adding additional keywords Ohio OR Virginia   NOT Prune search results by removing certain keywords Vikings NOT football   \u0026quot;...\u0026quot; Return results containing an exact phrase \u0026ldquo;artificial intelligence\u0026rdquo;   * Truncation: used to capture all the word endings from a search term manufact*   ? Wildcard: Finds spelling variations organi?ation, wom?n    Boolean search examples These Boolean terms are described in more detail below:\nAND  Although it may seem counterintuitive, AND is used to narrow the number of sources you retrieve from a database. You can visualize the search of a large academic database or library catalog using the following diagram:\n  { linguistics AND cognitive AND childhood }\nIn the search depicted above, a student has requested articles that contain the subjects cognitive, linguistics, and childhood. This particular search will only retrieve articles that contain all three terms. This small subset of the larger subject sets is referenced by the arrow. All the information represented by the other portions of the three circles will be excluded. Thus, even if an article contains two of the three search terms, it will be excluded from the results.\nThis search could have been improved with truncation, described below.    OR  Unlike the AND operator, OR seeks to broaden a search, as in this example:\n  { Virginia OR Ohio }\nIn the search depicted above, a student has searched for the subjects Virginia OR Ohio. This search will return every article having the subject of Virginia as well as every article with the subject of Ohio. Unlike the AND search, where only articles containing both terms are returned in the search results, the OR search yields every source on both subjects regardless of whether those subjects appear together in the same source. As a consequence, the OR search will produce far more results.\n Since the OR operator lacks precision, it is most often used in parenthetical searches, described below.    NOT  The Boolean operator NOT is used to subtract or screen out topics or keywords that are unwanted within the search results.\n  { \u0026ldquo;alternative energy\u0026rdquo; NOT solar }\nIn the search depicted above, a student is researching alternative energy and wants to exclude any information dealing with solar energy. To remove all references to solar energy, the student has searched for \u0026ldquo;alternative energy,\u0026rdquo; but has removed any articles from the search results that contain the subject solar using the operator NOT.\nThe NOT operator is helpful when you find your search results are polluted with unwanted items. This is often a problem when two distinct things share the same name. For example, if you were researching the Norse explorers known as the Vikings, you might discover that your search results include unwanted information about the Minnesota Vikings football team. You can subtract these unwanted results by searching for Vikings NOT Minnesota or Vikings NOT football, for example.\nThis search uses quotation marks to form an exact phrase search, described below.    Advanced searching These Boolean operators can be used to create long, increasingly precise search strings when they are fortified with more advanced operators: parentheticals, exact phrases, and wildcards.\nParenthetical searches You can also use the various Boolean search terms in tandem using parenthetical constructions:\n  (Ohio OR Virginia) AND unemployment\n  (cognitive AND linguistics) NOT childhood\n  Such parenthetical searches follow the order of operations, like in math equations. In the first example, the search will first combine all the articles with the keyword of Ohio to all the articles with the keyword Virginia, creating a large collection of search results. Afterward, the keyword unemployment will be applied to that collection using the AND operator, yielding the final search results that look for sources dealing with unemployment in either Virginia and Ohio. Similarly, the second example creates a large collection of results that share the subjects cognitive and linguistics, then all the items having the term childhood are removed from the results.\n  Exact phrase searches  Most Internet search engines and library catalogs default to the AND operator when multiple terms are entered, even if it has not been typed by the user. For example, if you search for artificial intelligence, the search algorithm will actually use the search string artificial AND intelligence to produce your results. In some circumstances this may produce undesirable results. For example, we might imagine an article about the \u0026ldquo;intelligence\u0026rdquo; of using certain \u0026ldquo;artificial\u0026rdquo; sweeteners in food for children. This is not an article that is relevant for your project.\nTo avoid this problem, you can instruct your search engine to perform what is known as an exact phrase search. This is performed by placing quotation marks around the exact words you are searching for:\n \u0026ldquo;artificial intelligence\u0026rdquo; AND apocalypse  By searching for \u0026ldquo;artificial intelligence\u0026rdquo; your search results will only contain items that have that exact phrase within the document or title.\n  Truncation and wildcards    manufact* (truncation)\n  wom?n (wild card)\n  If you search for the terms steel AND manufacturing, your search results may not include results with the terms manufacturer, manufacture, manufactured, or manufactures. As a result, you may not discover articles or books that are important to your research. By truncating the word with an asterisk, however, you will gather all the relevant search results.\nSimilarly, if you only search for woman, you will potentially miss out on the all the texts that mention women or womyn. Or imagine that you are doing research on a certain type of organization. It would be wise to search for organi?ation, since much of the English-speaking world spells the word with an \u0026ldquo;s\u0026rdquo; instead of a \u0026ldquo;z\u0026rdquo; as we do here in the US. Without this, your research may become skewed to favor the literature on US-based institutions. However, using the wild card ? you will search all spellings simultaneously, gathering all the relevant results. The question mark wild card should be used to replace a single letter only.\nTo illustrate, look at these two searches on the JSTOR database:\n  Iraq and manufacturing (14,863 results)\n  Iraq and manufact* (30,868 results) 👀️\n    Finding a Book in the Library Libraries use classification systems to organize their holdings. The most common in the English-speaking world are the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) and the Library of Congress Classification (LCC) systems. There are a number of other library systems. In Europe, for example, you will encounter the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) system. Like most research libraries in the US, Dartmouth\u0026rsquo;s libraries use the Library of Congress system.\nThe Library of Congress System The Library of Congress assigns every copyrighted book a unique call number consisting of a series of numbers and letters that help you locate them on the library\u0026rsquo;s shelves and indicate the subject matter contained within it. A typical call number will resemble the following:\n F 24 .T39 1990  Let\u0026rsquo;s break down the call number into its constituent parts:\n   Call Number Name Purpose or Use     F Letter line Indicates subject matter or discipline of the book and the section of the library where the book is shelved.You can examine the full list of subject classes at the Library of Congress.   24 Whole number line Indicates a narrower subtopic within a discipline or subject.Tells you which row the book is on in the stacks.   .T39 Cutter line Identifies the individual book.The first letter of the Cutter line is usually the first letter of the author’s last name.   1990 Edition/Date line Tells you the book’s year of publication.May also include volume or edition information.    Steps to find a book on the shelf Step 1: Letter Line  F 24 .T39 1990 Using the letter line, determine the floor of the library where the book is shelved. The library\u0026rsquo;s floorplan maps will help you locate the proper section. Using our example call number above, we can determine that the F section is in Stack Level A.\n        Step 2: Whole Number Line  F 24 .T39 1990 Once on the appropriate floor, use the whole number line to find the row where the book is shelved in the stacks. Using the example call number, we will look through the stacks for the number 24. Each library floor has a floormaps to help guide you; they are available in .pdf form or are posted on the wall of each floor, near the entrance.\nAs you walk through the stacks, look on the ends of each row for signs describing the range of books held within the row such as the one below:\n  { Use these signs to determine if a book is in the row. }\nSince F 24 is within this range, our example book is in that row. Once in the proper row of shelves, proceed numerically until you find the 24s.\n  Step 3: Cutter Line  F 24 .T39 1990 Finally, using the Cutter line, proceed alphabetically until you hit the Ts. Then proceed numerically until you find .T39, the address of our book.\n The date or volume information at the end of a call number will only be useful to you if you are looking for a particular edition of a book.    As you can see, the call number should be read from left to right using alphabetical and numerical orders. Thus, a book with a Subject line F would be shelved before a book with a Subject line FA. Similarly, a Cutter line that reads .T39 is shelved after .T21.\nMaps of the library\u0026rsquo;s floorplans are affixed to the walls on each floor. Free paper maps of the library are available at the circulation desk of the library. You may also consult the maps and floorplans online with your computer or smartphone.\nOr, just forget all of that A new update to Dartmouth\u0026rsquo;s catalog as of 2014 allows you to simply click the \u0026ldquo;map it\u0026rdquo; button next to the item\u0026rsquo;s listing in the catalog.\n  \nClicking this button will summon a map that shows you the approximate location of the book in the library stacks.\n   Getting sources our library doesn\u0026rsquo;t own A common problem in academic research is discovering that a book or article you require for a project is checked out, missing, or not owned by the library. There are a number of free services available to you when you encounter this problem.\nBorrow Direct consortium A number of the best libraries in the world have formed a consortium designed to share resources and expand research opportunities for the entire academic community. As students of Dartmouth College, you may obtain borrowing privileges at any of the other participating libraries including Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Chicago, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton, Yale and the Center for Research Libraries. The combined resources total a staggering 50 million volumes.\nTo see if a book is available at another library, use a service called Borrow Direct. With this service you may search every library in the consortium simultaneously to see if the book you require is available at another institution. If the book is owned by another school and is not checked out at the time, you may request that the item be sent to our library. These requests usually arrive in 4 working days or less.\nDartDoc If there is a book or article you would like to read that is not available through Borrow Direct, you may request it from Dartmouth\u0026rsquo;s interlibrary loan program, known as DartDoc. To request an item, visit the DartDoc webpage, select the appropriate form (article, book, book chapter, etc.), and send your request electronically to the office. Staff will request your item from another library, who will ship the book to our library through the mail. If you are requesting a book chapter or article, the donor library will send you a .pdf free of charge to your DartDoc account.\nIf you are ordering a book, DartDoc is the slowest of all the available options for requesting research materials. Requests may take up to two weeks to be fulfilled.\nResearch guides If you are performing research on a topic and do not know where to begin, Dartmouth\u0026rsquo;s librarians have created an impressive collection of Research Guides that can help you find background information, periodical databases, and academic journals appropriate for your topic or discipline.\nPeer review Peer review is a form of quality control in academic publishing. Before books or articles are published, they experience a rigorous process of evaluation by at least three experts who have advanced training in the field of study in question. These \u0026ldquo;referees,\u0026rdquo; as they are known, review the work anonymously. This anonymity theoretically ensures a more honest appraisal of the work under consideration for publication. When it works as intended, this scholarly review helps eliminate factual errors and other problems before the works are published. Thus, peer-reviewed works are more trustworthy than other sources of information.\nDetermining if a source is peer reviewed For novice researchers, distinguishing peer-reviewed sources from other published information can be challenging. Perhaps the best advice is to use only sources that you located within the library system, rather than things you found with a search engine on the open internet. You are far more likely to encounter trustworthy sources this way. Of course, is is also frequently the case that excellent information may be found on the open web; in these cases, we must use our best judgment to determine if the source is trustworthy or not. If you are confused about a source, ask your professor or one of the research librarians for assistance in making a determination.\nQuick tests for peer review Here are a few test criteria that you may use to make a judgment call about whether a source has been peer reviewed:\n Scholarly, peer-reviewed books are often published by an academic press associated with a college or university of repute. These publishers will have names like: Yale University Press or Duke University Press. Scholarly, peer-reviewed articles are almost always written by credentialed scholars (often the text will contain the university affiliation of the professor/author/scientist). Scholarly articles and books always have a bibliography. Scholarly articles always contain citations and commonly have footnotes or endnotes. Generally speaking, if you can find the publication at the dentist’s office or on an airport magazine rack, then it isn’t scholarly or peer-reviewed. If the article contains advertisements, it is likely not scholarly.  How to find peer-reviewed sources Many periodical databases only contain peer-reviewed academic articles. A good example is JSTOR. Any article you find there will have been peer reviewed. Many other databases, such as Academic Search Complete, have search limiters that can be selected to ensure that the search results only contain peer-reviewed sources. Our own library catalog search engine provides the ability to limit the search to peer-reviewed books and periodicals.\nThe Oxford English Dictionary The OED is, without question, the greatest and most complete dictionary ever created. As an historical dictionary, the OED systematically traces the etymology of words in the English language. Etymology is \u0026ldquo;the study of the history of words, their origins, and how their form and meaning have changed over time.\u0026rdquo; Thus, with the OED you can see when a word entered or exited the English language and how its meaning evolved over time.\nThe OED is quite helpful when you are reading a novel, poem, or document that was written in a time period distant from our own. Since words fall out of use and the meanings of words change over time, it can often be difficult to interpret the meaning of the texts we read from the past. The OED exists to help us with this problem. You can think of it as a dictionary with a built-in time machine.\nHelpful research suggestions Not all sources are equal How do you know if you can trust your source? Here are some suggestions for critically examining your sources:\n  Examine the credentials of the author. What is the author\u0026rsquo;s educational background? Do they have an advanced degree in the subject that they are writing about? Are they affiliated with any major institutions\u0026mdash;such as a university or government department? Does the author have a respected publication record that is frequently cited by other experts in the field?\n  Examine the date of publication. When was the book or article you are reading published? Since new discoveries and ideas are produced every day, it is important to consult the most recent sources on your research subject. Generally, the most current source should be preferred over older sources.\n  Determine if the source has been peer-reviewed. Peer review is a form of quality control in academic publishing. It ensures that the information that is published has been properly evaluated and vetted by a number of other professionals in the field. A peer-reviewed source should be preferred over any other kind of information.\n  Be wary of Internet sources. If your source comes from the Internet, you should take care to verify its trustworthiness. Most sites on the Internet are not peer-reviewed sources of information. Misleading, politically motivated, and even propagandistic content often masquerades as objective information on blogs, websites, and discussion boards.\n  Taking notes Now that you have some research materials in front of you, either at the library or at home, it\u0026rsquo;s time to make them useful to you. Before placing source materials in your essay, take good notes by using summary, paraphrase, and judicious quotation to take ownership of the source materials. Ensure that you cite appropriately and that your summaries and paraphrases use your own original language. This intermediary step before writing the essay saves you time and helps you avoid plagiarism.\nCitation Chasing; Or, Raiding the Bibliography Students find one or two sources on a topic and then despair of finding any more. However, with just one excellent article or book, you can easily generate additional research leads. When you find a book or article that relates to your project, scour the bibliography to see what books and articles the author used to produce his or her work. Make lists of the most promising sources by writing down all the bibliographic information in a research journal. Locate these sources in the library and then repeat the process. By using this technique of routinely following up on sources cited in bibliographies, you can generate a surprisingly large number of books and articles on your topic in a relatively short time.\n Some databases, such as Web of Science, offer the ability to browse references automatically.  Research journal \u0026amp; bibliographic software Keeping a research journal is an important habit to develop. Every student or professor has had the unsettling realization that they have used a quotation in their writing but have no recollection of where the quote came from. Many hours can be consumed retracing steps. Frequently, source materials are never located again. To avoid this problem, keep a research journal where you record the bibliographic information of each source you read or browse. This way you can quickly locate the information again.\nAlthough a paper notebook works well as a research journal, there are some very promising electronic alternatives. This bibliographic software can maintain a record of your sources, help you take notes, and even produce perfectly formatted bibliography pages for your essays.\nI recommend that you use Zotero if you are interested in an electronic reference manager. It is free, open-source, and integrates with our library well. There are other options that cost money. For Mac users, there is Bookends. PC users may consider Biblioscape.\n"});index.add({'id':30,'href':'/resources/open-handbook/chapter-14/','title':"On Style",'content':"On Style  I don\u0026rsquo;t usually talk about style with students, or teach it in any way.

Documentation of Sources",'content':"Documentation of Sources  Accurately documenting sources is a vital aspect of any process of inquiry. If you fail to properly document your sources, your readers will be unable to follow your research, validate your claims, or judge the quality of your argument. Furthermore, failing to properly cite a source (whether summarized, paraphrased, or quoted) opens you to the charge of plagiarism, a serious academic offense.\nScholars avoid plagiarism and give credit to the thinking and writing of others using a variety of citation formats, or \u0026ldquo;styles.\u0026rdquo; As you work to complete your degree in college you will encounter a number of these citation formats. In fact, each discipline has a preferred style. The humanities use MLA, psychology uses APA, history and other social sciences use Chicago. There are many others. As you begin to specialize in a particular field of study, you will be expected to use the citation style of your discipline. This brief handbook, however, will only introduce you to two of the most common styles: MLA and Chicago.\nAlthough citation formats differ significantly, they all have two primary components: in-text citations and a bibliography. As the name suggests, in-text citations are used to reference the work of others within the text itself; the bibliography contains an ordered list of all the in-text citations contained within a piece of writing.\n"});index.add({'id':32,'href':'/resources/open-handbook/chapter-13/','title':"Common Sentence Errors",'content':"Common Sentence Errors  A statistical study of student writing performed in 1988 by scholars Andrea Lunsford and Robert Connors demonstrated that virtually 100% student writing mistakes are limited to 20 formal errors.

Faulty Parallelism Parallel structure involves using the same form of words or structural pattern when crafting a sentence. In the example above, the author uses gerunds for the first two verbs but then changes to the infinitive form for the last verb. Generally, parallel structure sounds much better to the ear than otherwise:\n     He was good at swearing, fighting, and liked to drink.\n      He was good at swearing, fighting, and drinking.\n         They were informed that they should not eat before swimming, that they should not eat sugar, and to do some exercises before bed.\n      They were informed that they should not eat before swimming, that they should not eat sugar, and that they should not skip exercise before bed.\n    7.

Missing comma with a nonrestrictive element A nonrestrictive element is a part of a sentence that is not essential to its meaning. Commas are used to set off these nonessential portions of the sentence:\n     The Boston Red Sox, who are my favorite baseball team, are having a rough time with middle relievers.\n   9. Missing comma in compound sentence A compound sentence contains two or more clauses that can stand alone as complete sentences (otherwise known as \u0026ldquo;independent clauses\u0026rdquo;). However, to connect them as a single sentence you must either use a semicolon or a comma and a coordinating conjunction: for, and, not, but, or, yet, so. (You can remember these with the acrostic F.A.N.B.O.Y.S.) Failing to punctuate the compound sentence properly results in a fused, or run-on, sentence:\n     I am building a bunker in my backyard but I am not fearful of a zombie outbreak.\n      I am building a bunker in my backyard, but I am not fearful of a zombie outbreak.\n   10.

Lack of agreement between pronoun and antecedent Pronouns and their antecedents must always agree in number. There are three rules that govern the choice between singular or plural pronouns: 1) Sentences that begin with an indefinite pronoun (such as everyone and each) are always treated as singular. 2) If antecedents are joined by or or nor, the pronoun must agree with the closer antecedent. 3) Collective nouns can be either singular or plural depending on whether the people are seen as a single unit or a group of individuals:\n     Each of the prisoners found happiness in their work.\n      Each of the prisoners found happiness in his work.\n         Either Jeff or Robert will be required to give up their car.\n      Either Jeff or Robert will be required to give up his car.\n         The campaign constantly changed its positions in the weeks before the election.\n      The campaign constantly changed their positions in the weeks before the election.\n   13.

However, doing so is rarely a simple process of cutting and pasting the words from a source into your own document. Instead, you will routinely encounter challenges during the quotation of a source that threaten the clarity and correctness of your prose. For example:\n   What do you do when you are writing in the present tense and the source material you are quoting uses the past tense? Simply pasting these words in without alteration will lead to odd shifts in tense.\n   What if the sentence you want to quote contains extraneous words or phrases that are a distraction from your intended purpose? Leaving these extra words or phrases in the quotation may lead your readers to become confused or bored.\n   What if a term in your quotation needs some sort of clarification so that your audience will understand what meaning you intend? Left unremarked, your readers may miss the point of your ideas or become confused.\n   What if you need to change the capitalization of a letter in the source text after placing it within the context of your writing? Leaving this unchanged would violate the rules of capitalization and make you appear sloppy or careless.\n  Issues such as these are a common problem in academic writing since the use of sources is so central to the enterprise.\nSo, what do you do in these situations? This exercise will introduce you to ellipsis and brackets which are used to alter source material during quotation. These are important tools to wield as you take part in academic conversations.\nSource Text Source Text  -From Walker Percy, \u0026ldquo;The Loss of the Creature,\u0026rdquo; p. 47.\n Why is it almost impossible to gaze directly at the Grand Canyon under these circumstances and see it for what it is—as one picks up a strange object from one\u0026rsquo;s back yard and gazes directly at it? It is almost impossible because the Grand Canyon, the thing as it is, has been appropriated by the symbolic complex which has already been formed in the sightseer\u0026rsquo;s mind. Seeing the canyon under approved circumstances is seeing the symbolic complex head on. The thing is no longer the thing as it confronted the Spaniard; it is rather that which has already been formulated—by picture postcard, geography book, tourist folders, and the words Grand Canyon. As a result of this preformulation, the source of the sightseer\u0026rsquo;s pleasure undergoes a shift. Where the wonder and delight of the Spaniard arose from his penetration of the thing itself, from a progressive discovery of depths, patterns, colors, shadows, etc., now the sightseer measures his satisfaction by the degree to which the canyon conforms to the preformed complex.\n   Workshop Using the source text provided above, write the sentences or paragraphs assigned below.

You will be asked to engage these texts critically and to challenge the thinking and conclusions of others. You will also have to retain an extraordinary amount of information and recall it later. To thrive in this environment you will need to develop some new habits and strategies. The most basic, and most fundamental, of these is a formal procedure for the annotation of texts.\nWhat is annotation? Annotation refers to the process of making meaningful marks on a text as you read it. These marks are helpful for a number of reasons that I describe in the first chapter of the Open Handbook. This chapter comes first because it is perhaps the most important new skill and habit that you can develop as a first-year student.\nAnnotation strategies Since you have likely never engaged a text in such a manner, here are some strategies that you might consider as you develop a process for annotation and critical reading:\n  Use a symbol system. Develop a system of symbols to flag important aspects of a reading. Mark significant elements within the text such as the thesis, argumentative claims, and evidence. Also note when a text references other texts, authors, or events. Note places where you become confused or uncertain; later, in a second reading, you can give extra attention to these portions of the text.\n  Interrogate the text. Ask probing questions back to the author in the margins of the text. Be skeptical. Be ruthless. Be rigorous. Challenge the conclusions and arguments that he or she presents by making ones of your own.\n  Summarize. Write keywords or make “microsummaries” in the margins next to each paragraph. Later, you will not have to re-read the entire document to find your place. These can be especially useful if you later use this text in your own writing.\n  Connect.

During this class we will try to train our minds to uncover the argumentative structure of all that we read.\nWorkshop Relying on your annotations and critical notes, construct an outline of the argument found in Nicholson Baker\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;Changes of Mind\u0026rdquo; essay.\nYour focus in this assignment is on the essay\u0026rsquo;s argumentative structure. What is the main conclusion that Baker wants you to accept? We can call this central claim his thesis. What other supporting claims does he make to bolster this conclusion?\nBaker is a very playful writer; there is a lot of silliness and extravagant verbal excess in the essay. This makes it challenging to distinguish argumentative claims from his examples, metaphors, illustrations, and stories. Your job is to carefully sift through the essay to isolate the arguments, separating them from all the \u0026ldquo;fluff\u0026rdquo; and verbal pyrotechnics.\nWhat to Do Create a document that simply presents Baker\u0026rsquo;s argumentative claims as a numbered list arranged in a logical order.\n  [Submit this assignment to Canvas](https://canvas.dartmouth.edu) --- "});index.add({'id':41,'href':'/courses/workshops/argument-summary/','title':"Argument Summary",'content':"   Argument Summary  In a summary you present the ideas of another writer in condensed form. The length of a summary is dictated by your rhetorical needs, but they are always shorter than the original text. For example, the summary of a large book could be 20 pages, one paragraph, or one sentence. Although a summary sacrifices specificity and detail in the interest of brevity, it must always remain a faithful representation of the original text\u0026rsquo;s meaning.\nWe will practice summary by writing one of Nicholson Baker’s argument in “Changes of Mind.\u0026quot; Your summary should not exceed 250 words. Include all of Baker’s argumentative claims or assertions. Leave nothing out. Put nothing extra in. Remain objective: don\u0026rsquo;t tell the audience your opinions or how you feel about Baker\u0026rsquo;s writing or argument. Just give us the facts.\n  Don’t forget to provide MLA-formatted citations indicating the page number(s) of the points you summarize. Use the Open Handbook for help crafting appropriate signal phrases.\n  One of the main skills required here is the ability to distinguish assertions \u0026amp; claims from examples \u0026amp; metaphors. Given the word limit in this assignment, you should focus on presenting the former pair and not the latter pair. Just present the argument to your reader as you understand it.\n  Your work in the argument analysis workshop should be very helpful to you. Although you may worked with partners to decide what to include in the summary, you must write your own.\n  Common questions Can I use a quotation in a summary?\n Sure, why not? Of course, you need to strike a balance. If you overdo it, the thing you write ceases to be a summary and becomes more like a tissue of quotations. But the judicious use of quotations happens in summary and paraphrase all the time.  Can I use no quotations in a summary?\n Sure, why not? You may choose to use your own words to explain the ideas of another writer. It is occasionally quite valuable to offer the exact words of another writer. But that is not necessarily the case here. The important thing is that you accurately communicate the thinking of another writer under the assigned word count.

As the name suggests, synthesis involves combining and connecting. Your focus in a synthesis essay is to explain to your audience the ways in which two or more arguments relate to each another.\nStudents attempting synthesis for the first time often make the mistake of organizing their essays by source. For example, they will introduce two authors in their introduction, summarize Author A for a few paragraphs, summarize Author B for a few paragraphs, then conclude the essay by noting the broad similarities and differences in the two authors’ thinking. This is not synthesis.\nIn a synthesis essay you should try to organize your essay by topic or questions at issue rather than by source. Instead of summarizing the essays separately, a synthesis will attempt to discover the various things that the authors discuss\u0026mdash;the questions, ideas, and arguments they have in common\u0026mdash;then present those things in an organized and meaningful way to an audience who is unfamiliar with the texts. Thus, your objective in a synthesis is to bring two or more distinct sources into a relationship by explaining to your reader the various ways in which the sources are in dialogue.\nTo begin a synthesis, ask yourself the following questions about the readings you plan to synthesize:\n  What issues, topics, or problems do the source materials have in common? Are their arguments those things similar, or do they differ in some respects? What reasoning supports their arguments? Do they offer similar conclusions or are there significant differences?   Answering these questions makes it easier to write an essay examining the relationship between the various authors’ arguments, comparing and contrasting their views.\n Synthesis is very textual in nature: you must show explicit textual evidence for each of the claims you attribute to the other authors. Using summary, paraphrase, and quotation, compare and contrast the authors’ positions; make sure to cite each reference a text appropriately. Use clear signal phrases to alert the reader when you transition between your presentations of the various author’s ideas or works.  Workshop Walker Percy and Paulo Freire, each in their own way, ask us to consider the problem of authority within particular educational systems or pedagogical practices. Map out the various ways in which these two authors examine the same problem or set of issues. How do they describe the problem? What terms to do they use? Are these terms used to communicate a similar issue or concern? What are the effects of these problems on the human beings who \u0026ldquo;experience\u0026rdquo; them? What further consequences befall those who are trained in these improper forms of education? What solutions do Percy and Freire offer to this problem? Are these views compatible?\nMuch as you did in a previous workshop, map out all of these argumentative connections between the two texts, producing an organized list. Flag similar terms or language that can help you draw comparisons or make connections. Make sure to scrupulously cite each reference to the text so you won\u0026rsquo;t waste time trying to find them again later.\n  6 Hive page for Synthesis Essay  7 Hive page for Synthesis Essay    [Submit this assignment to Canvas](https://canvas.dartmouth.edu) --- "});index.add({'id':43,'href':'/courses/workshops/bibliographic-management/','title':"Bibliographic Management",'content':"   Bibliographic Management  "});index.add({'id':44,'href':'/resources/open-handbook/chapter-11-chi/','title':"Chicago Documentation Style",'content':"Chicago Style  Chicago document formatting When setting up your word processor for an Chicago-formatted document, use the following settings to format your page:\nChicago Page Formatting    Use one-inch margins on all sides of the document.\n  Place the page number on the right side of each page in the document\u0026rsquo;s header. If instructed to do so by a professor, include your last name before the page number on each page.\n  Double space the document.\n  Block quotes are formed when a quote runs more than 100 words. Indent the entire block of text with a 1/2-inch tab from the left margin.\n  Endnotes and bibliographic entries are single-spaced with a blank line separating them.\n  Indent the first line of a note entry with a 1/2-inch tab.\n  Indent the second, and any subsequent, line of a bibliographic entry with a 1/2-inch tab.\n  The Chicago form requires a title page. The title of the essay is centered about 1/3 down the top of the page. Place your name, course information, and date on three separate, centered lines at the center of the document.\n  The title page is counted but not numbered. This means that the first page of your essay proper will be numbered 2 and your title page will have no page number on it.\n  Example:       Chicago Notes page formatting The Chicago style has two ways of approaching citation. In one method, known as author-date, references are placed in the text within a parenthesis using the author\u0026rsquo;s last name and the year of the source\u0026rsquo;s publication. The author-date method is common in the sciences and social sciences. A second method is known as notes and bibliography. In this method, in-text citations are made using either footnotes, which appear at the bottom of a page, or endnotes, which appear on a separate Notes page at the conclusion of the document. This handbook only presents the notes and bibliography method with endnotes.\nTo set up your Notes page properly, follow the rules below:\nFormatting the Notes page  Setting up the Notes page When setting up the Notes page, use the following rules:\n  Center the word \u0026ldquo;Notes\u0026rdquo; at the top of the page.\n  Place the page number on the right side of each page in the document\u0026rsquo;s header. If instructed to do so by a professor, include your last name before the page number on each page.\n  Single-space the endnotes with a line separating entries.\n  Indent the first line of an endnote entry with a 1/2-inch tab.\n  Making endnote or footnote entries When making footnote or endnote entries, the Chicago form prescribes a specific strategy designed to lessen the work involved. While this design ultimately means less typing, a number of strict rules must be followed:\n  Present the citations in the numerical order as they appear within the text.\n  The first time a source is cited, use the full Chicago notes form.\n  If the same source is used more than once, the shorthand version of the Chicago notes form is used the second (and each subsequent) time. The shorthand version contains a) the author\u0026rsquo;s last name, b) a shortened version of the title, and c) the page number(s) of the citation.\n  If a source is used twice (or more) in a row, the Latin abbreviation \u0026ldquo;Ibid.\u0026rdquo; is used along with the page number, rather than the shorthand version of the form. (Ibid. means \u0026ldquo;in the same place.\u0026quot;)\n  If a source is used twice (or more) in a row and the citation is from the same page, \u0026ldquo;Ibid.\u0026rdquo; is used by itself without the page number.\n  Example:     Chicago Bibliography page formatting The Chicago style does not require that you include a bibliography page at the conclusion of your essay; the Notes page is often sufficient unless the work is very long or contains a large number of citations. However, your professor may require one. To construct a Chicago bibliography, follow the rules below:\nFormatting the Bibliography page  Setting up the Bibliography page To format a Chicago bibliography page, use the following rules:\n  Place the bibliography page after the notes page.\n  Place the page number on the right side of each page in the document\u0026rsquo;s header. If instructed to do so by a professor, include your last name before the page number on each page.\n  Center the word \u0026ldquo;Bibliography\u0026rdquo; at the top of the page.\n  Single-space entries with a line separating entries.\n  Alphabetize by the author\u0026rsquo;s last name.\n  Indent the second (and any subsequent) line of an entry with a 1/2-inch tab.\n  Example:     Chicago in-text citations When using Chicago\u0026rsquo;s notes and bibliography method of citation, in-text citations are made using either footnotes, which appear at the bottom of a page, or endnotes, which appear on a separate \u0026ldquo;Notes\u0026rdquo; page at the conclusion of the document. This handbook exclusively presents the notes and bibliography method using endnotes.\nChicago in-text citations  In-text citations In the Chicago form, an in-text citation is indicated by a superscript number resembling the following:\n Recent scholarship on the concept of sovereignty has displayed a remarkable lack of interest in Native peoples.7\n This in-text reference will correspond to either a footnote at the bottom of the page or an endnote on the Notes page at the conclusion of the document. The reference will resemble the one below:\n7. Giorgio Agamben, Homo Sacer: Sovereign Power and Bare Life (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1998), 96.

It\u0026rsquo;s a really good list. You should read it.\nHere is my own list, focusing on the core competencies of the rhetorical arts. As I see it, the following are the most critical skills for successful writing and thinking in an academic context. None of these things is particularly easy to master, if such a thing is actually possible. But practice and experience can yield results. We will spend much of our time this year learning about and practicing the complex skills described on this list.\n What are the characteristics of someone educated in the rhetorical arts?   They analyze. Analysis involves breaking a complex thing down into smaller parts so that you may understand how those parts work together to form a whole (or fail to do so). Students should be able to expose the weaknesses or strengths of an argument\u0026rsquo;s construction by tearing it down to the studs, thereby revealing a text\u0026rsquo;s underlying purpose, structure, and support. This practice involves identifying a text\u0026rsquo;s thesis, claims, evidence, reasons, allusions, and assumptions (among other things). Students should also be able to bring this same sort of critical analysis to bear on images, art, spaces, advertisements, memes, cultural artifacts, and performances of various sorts.   They read actively and think critically. Students should not be passive consumers of texts, but active and critical interrogators of what they read. Students should be able to think critically about the arguments and evidence presented by other writers by assessing their value and suitability. Students should recognize specious reasoning and sophistry when they see it. They should ask probing questions of the ideas and arguments they encounter, insisting that each argument earn its conclusions. Active, critical readers imagine the experience of reading as a dialogue, a conversation that we have with other people through the medium of text.   They accurately re-present the thinking of others. Students should be able to accurately re-present the ideas and arguments of other writers in their own writing. This competency is more complex that it appears as it encompasses several discrete skills: reading comprehension, paraphrase, summary, and quotation.   They synthesize. Students should be able to explain to a broad audience how two or more distinct arguments or ideas relate to each other, a practice known as synthesis. A synthesis involves discovering the various questions, ideas, and arguments two or more texts have in common, then presenting those things in an organized, meaningful, and original way. Thus, synthesis seeks to bring two or more distinct sources into a relationship by explaining to the audience the various ways in which the sources are in dialogue.   They make sound arguments. Students should be able to make effective arguments that use claims, evidence, and reasoning to support a thesis that is convincing to a particular audience.   They use theories. Students should be able to make use of the arguments made by others by applying these found ideas to new contexts. This is often referred to as \u0026ldquo;theoretical\u0026rdquo; argumentation or a \u0026ldquo;lens\u0026rdquo; essay.   They demonstrate audience awareness. Students should be able to think clearly about the audience they hope to address and persuade with their writing, then make appropriate rhetorical choices so as to make the best possible case. An awareness of the audience will often lead a writer to thoughtfully provide appropriate contextualizing information designed to help orient and prepare readers. This might involve defining obscure jargon, explaining the historical context, synthesizing elements of the larger academic conversation, revealing the credentials of a quoted authority, etc.   They make connections. Students should be able to make connections between disparate things\u0026mdash;across disciplines, texts, theories, cultural practices, religions, histories, etc. These sorts of connections allow us to see and understand in new, creative ways.   They remain vulnerable to new ideas and information. Students should know that they don\u0026rsquo;t know everything\u0026mdash;that there are other ways of seeing and knowing they are unaware of. Some of these ideas and views may be deeply challenging to their own deeply held ones. They may, in fact, be utterly incommensurable. Yet, students should be able to cultivate a spirit of openness, generosity, and understanding\u0026mdash;an intellectual and emotional vulnerability to new ideas and the experiences of others. This is not a facile nihilism, but an openness to discovery and a recognition of one\u0026rsquo;s own fallibility and ignorance.   They inquire. Good students are curious. They enjoy solving complex problems. They love learning for its own sake and view education as a process of exploration, discovery, and becoming. They seek truth and wisdom. They know that education is not a state of being\u0026mdash;not something that we ever fully achieve. Rather, it is something that forever eludes our grasp despite our most dogged efforts.  "});index.add({'id':46,'href':'/courses/workshops/cutting-corners/','title':"Cutting Corners",'content':"   Cutting Corners in Research I can\u0026rsquo;t tell you the number of times a first-year student has waited until the other students left the classroom in order to sheepishly approach me ask this question: \u0026ldquo;Professor, if I get a book from the library or download an article for my research project, do I have to read the whole thing?\u0026rdquo;\nDon\u0026rsquo;t be silly; of course not.\nAnd I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you a secret: professors don\u0026rsquo;t read everything in their field(s) of study either. There is just too much information and it appears too rapidly to carefully consume it all. It\u0026rsquo;s akin to drinking out of a fire hose. What this means is that you have to make choices. What are your priorities? Given the time and interests you have, which texts look worth a slow, patient, deeply critical reading? Professors home in on those texts and spend most of their time with them. And yet, professors somehow keep abreast of all the work happening in their field of study and still have time for family and football. How do they do that?\nProfessors (and very strong students) have developed extremely efficient forms of reading and related practices that can take the place of thoroughly reading a text from beginning to end. These skills are very applicable to first-year students who need to write a long research essay on an unfamiliar topic in a short 10-week term.\nOn Reading Ruthlessly First, let\u0026rsquo;s stipulate that nothing can replace carefully reading a book or article from beginning to end. \u0026ldquo;Speed reading\u0026rdquo; is a gimmick\u0026mdash;the scholastic version of the Shake Weight. But often there is no need to read every word of a text, especially when you are just trying to assess whether a text is even relevant to your research project. Of course, the texts that you end up relying on for your research projects must be read carefully and critically, but it is best to adopt a method of testing sources before you commit to such a deep reading. So, before you try to read something in its entirety (an activity that could take many hours or even days), try the following list of approaches to the text:\n  Skim the prefatory material. Scholarly books (and most nonfiction) almost always contain a page that lists the chapters and other content. It may be that, upon examining this list, you can zero in on a single chapter that is relevant to your interests and skip the rest. Similarly, academic articles sometimes contain an \u0026ldquo;executive summary\u0026rdquo; written by the author that gives you an overview of the entire work in a single paragraph. Looking over these materials may lead you to read the work more carefully or jettison it for something better.\n  Read the introduction. The introduction of many academic texts will contain a concise statement about the main argument(s) of the entire text. In scholarly books this introduction frequently includes tight summaries of each chapter. The benefit of reading these is obvious: reading (or perhaps just heavily skimming) the introduction will provide you with an excellent summary and overview of the text. Again, this may convince you to read the text more seriously or return it to circulation. Introductions also frequently contain what are known as a \u0026ldquo;literature reviews,\u0026rdquo; where the scholarly conversation that surrounds the particular topic in question is summarized and the contribution the book offers to this critical context is described. The other texts and authors mentioned in the literature review may be quite useful to you as well, so take note to check out or download these texts as needed.\n  Read the conclusion. The conclusions of books, chapters, or articles are places where the author tries to state the worth and relevance of their work. These passages are often very revealing as they tell you quite a lot about whether the text\u0026rsquo;s earlier content will be useful or in sync with your project, arguments, and ideas.\n  Scan the topic sentences. One final test may be to skim the topic sentences of each paragraph in a chapter or article. Since the topic sentences generally state the paragraph\u0026rsquo;s purpose, you can often gain important intelligence on the whole text by reading them alone.\n  Surgical strikes with the index. Scholarly books often contain an index at the end of the text where key terms, events, or people are listed along with a page number. With this information you can quickly scan a book for keywords that are relevant for your line of inquiry and then visit those pages of the book to see if deeper reading is merited.\n  Read book reviews. Academic works are often reviewed by other academics in the pages of related academic journals. If you place the book\u0026rsquo;s title in the search field of a relevant database and use the search delimiter for \u0026ldquo;review articles,\u0026rdquo; you should receive a list of reviews. These reviews are usually only 2-3 pages in length, offer a precise summary of the book\u0026rsquo;s contents, and make some evaluative remarks at the end about the book\u0026rsquo;s value to the field of study.\n    Related reading:\n  Performing Citation Chases   Workshop  Choose an upcoming reading from this or any other class that you choose. Start a stopwatch timer on your phone. Proceed through strategies 1-4 with the text. After finishing, write a short summary of the text or any notes that seem important to you. Then stop the timer and note the time. Start the timer again and read the entire work very carefully, as you would normally. Annotate and take notes\u0026mdash;whatever your normal practice is for course readings. Once complete, stop the stopwatch.  Now, compare the results. What do you think?\n "});index.add({'id':47,'href':'/courses/workshops/locate-books/','title':"Finding a Book in the Library",'content':"Finding a Book in the Library Finding a book (or other physical resource) on the shelf of the library isn\u0026rsquo;t as easy as it sounds. This is a guide to help you understand how libraries are organized and find books you need for your research.\nLibrary Classification Systems Libraries use classification systems to organize their holdings. The most common in the English-speaking world are the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) and the Library of Congress Classification (LCC) systems. There are a number of other library systems. In Europe, for example, you will encounter the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) system. But like most research libraries in the US, Dartmouth\u0026rsquo;s libraries use the Library of Congress system.\nThe Library of Congress organizes all knowledge into a system of 21 basic subjects, each associated with a single letter of the alphabet. For example, the letter B is used to identify philosophy, psychology, and religion. Each of these subjects may be further refined with the addition of other letters. For example, BC is the subclass for Logic and BQ is the subclass for Buddhism. These subclasses may be refined even further with an alphanumeric code that represents a very specific research focus. When all of these letters and numbers are placed in a specific order, they form a unique code that is known as the book\u0026rsquo;s call number. The call number is listed in the book\u0026rsquo;s entry in the library\u0026rsquo;s catalog so that you may locate it on the shelves, or \u0026ldquo;stacks,\u0026rdquo; as they are known.\nThe Anatomy of a call number To find a book\u0026rsquo;s location in the library stacks, you need to know its call number. The Library of Congress assigns every copyrighted book a unique call number consisting of a series of numbers and letters that help you locate them on the library\u0026rsquo;s shelves and indicate the subject matter contained within it. A typical call number will resemble the following:\n  F 24 .T39 1990   Let\u0026rsquo;s break down the call number into its constituent parts:\n   Call Number Name Purpose or Use     F Letter line Indicates subject matter or discipline of the book and the section of the library where the book is shelved.You can examine the full list of subject classes at the Library of Congress.   24 Whole number line Indicates a narrower subtopic within a discipline or subject.Tells you which row the book is on in the stacks.   .T39 Cutter line Identifies the individual book.The first letter of the Cutter line is usually the first letter of the author’s last name.   1990 Edition/Date line Tells you the book’s year of publication.May also include volume or edition information after the year.    Steps to find a book on the shelf Method One: Step 1: Letter Line  F 24 .T39 1990 Use the letter line to determine the floor of the library where the book is shelved. The library\u0026rsquo;s floorplan maps will help you locate the proper section. Using our example call number above, we can determine that the F section is in Stack Level A.\n        Step 2: Whole Number Line  F 24 .T39 1990 Once on the appropriate floor, use the whole number line to find the row where the book is shelved in the stacks. Using the example call number, we will look through the stacks for the number 24. Each library floor has a floormaps to help guide you; they are available in .pdf form or are posted on the wall of each floor, near the entrance.\nAs you walk through the stacks, look on the ends of each row for signs describing the range of books held within the row such as the one below:\n  { Use these signs to determine if a book is in the row. }\nSince F 24 is within this range, our example book is in that row. Once in the proper row of shelves, proceed numerically until you find the 24s.\n  Step 3: Cutter Line  F 24 .T39 1990 Finally, using the Cutter line, proceed alphabetically until you hit the Ts. Then proceed numerically until you find .T39, the address of our book.\n The date or volume information at the end of a call number will only be useful to you if you are looking for a particular edition of a book.    As you can see, the call number should be read from left to right using alphabetical and numerical orders. Thus, a book with a Subject line F would be shelved before a book with a Subject line FA. Similarly, a Cutter line that reads .T39 is shelved after .T21.\nMaps of the library\u0026rsquo;s floorplans are affixed to the walls on each floor. Free paper maps of the library are available at the circulation desk of the library. You may also consult the maps and floorplans online with your computer or smartphone.\nMethod Two: Or Just Forget All That A new update to Dartmouth\u0026rsquo;s catalog as of 2014 allows you to simply click the \u0026ldquo;map it\u0026rdquo; button next to the item\u0026rsquo;s listing in the catalog.\n   Clicking this button will summon a map that shows you the approximate location of the book in the library stacks.\n     Workshop In a normal year when you are on campus and there is no pandemic, I would assign you each a book to find in the shelves and ask you to post a selfie with it in the stacks. But since most of you are not on campus, this will not be possible.\nInstead, find some book that you have lying around the house and locate it in our online catalog. Using the call number, try to find the exact location of of this book using the two methods described above.\n"});index.add({'id':48,'href':'/courses/workshops/find-periodicals/','title':"Finding Periodicals",'content':"   Finding Periodicals \u0026amp; Electronic Databases  Periodicals are publications that are published at regular intervals, such as scholarly journals, magazines, and newspapers. Examining periodicals\u0026mdash;especially academic journals\u0026mdash;is an important aspect of research. Since books often take a year or more to go through the process of peer review, editing, typesetting, and printing before they become available for purchase, they often do not contain the most current information. Articles, on the other hand, appear in a far shorter period of time and generally contain the most up-to-date research. For that reason, you should perform a review of journal articles on your research topic to ensure that you are aware of recent discoveries, arguments, and debates within the academic community who share your research focus.\nHowever, a common problem for undergraduate researchers is not knowing which databases or journals are appropriate to search in for information on a particular topic. There is no shame in this: unless you are a professional scholar, it is difficult to know what the leading journals are in a particular field of study. This is also a problem for faculty performing research outside of their areas of expertise. For example, an English professor would know that the academic journal PMLA or the database JSTOR are excellent places to look for articles on Herman Melville’s novel Moby Dick, but a physicist might not know where to begin.\nTo resolve this problem, our library has organized periodical databases by discipline in the Database Finder. You may also browse alphabetically if you know the name of the database you are looking for. This is designed to help you locate the specific journals, periodical databases, and reference materials that are appropriate for each discipline or research subject.\nWorkshop When you search for periodicals, it is best to choose a database that has good coverage for the discipline(s) you are working within. However, there are a few databases that have broad coverage of most fields of inquiry. These four databases could easily take you though your entire college career:\n Academic Search Complete JSTOR Web of Science ProQuest Central  Locate these databases at the library website: Home \u0026gt; Other Resources \u0026gt; Databases. Open a tab in your browser for each database for testing purposes.\n  Each database is unique, so you will have to familiarize yourself with how it works. Poke around a bit and get the lay of the land. Get to know these databases by using a keyword search string that you associate with your research project. Use the same search strings in each of the databases and see how the results differ.\n  Although it is very important to use Boolean searches within the databases, many databases offer additional search delimiters (generally located in the left pane as a series of check boxes) that allow you to further refine your searches. For example, I highly recommend that you check the delimiter that ensures you only receive peer-reviewed sources. You may also select to receive only full-text sources or just books and articles, not newspapers or reviews. There are many options to play with to massage your search results. Try to refine your search terms with this feature in each of the databases and see what happens.\n  The Web of Science database offers the ability to perform what is sometimes called a \u0026ldquo;citation chase,\u0026rdquo; where you may systematically examine all of an article\u0026rsquo;s citations as well as all of the articles that cite it\u0026mdash;a very handy tool that I reference in the Introduction to Academic Research.\n  "});index.add({'id':49,'href':'/courses/workshops/inter-library-loan/','title':"Getting Books/Articles We Don't Own",'content':"   Getting Sh*t the Library Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Have A common problem in academic research is discovering that a book or article you require for a project is checked out, missing, or not owned by the library. There are a number of free services available to you when you encounter this problem.\nBorrow Direct consortium A number of the best libraries in the world have formed a consortium designed to share resources and expand research opportunities for the entire academic community. As students at Dartmouth, you may obtain borrowing privileges at any of the other participating libraries including Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, MIT, University of Chicago, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton, Yale, and the Center for Research Libraries.\nTo see if a book is available at another library, use a service called Borrow Direct. With this service you may search every library in the consortium simultaneously to see if the book you require is available at another institution. If the book is owned by another school and is not checked out at the time, you may request that the item be sent to our library. These requests usually arrive in 4 working days or less. When they arrive, you will receive an email that it is being held for you at the circulation desk. Just tell the person behind the desk that you have a \u0026ldquo;hold\u0026rdquo; while giving them your ID. They will get the book for you.\n These texts have shorter borrowing periods. The book will arrive wrapped with a special sleeve containing information about when the book must be returned to avoid punishing fines.   Borrow Direct only works for books. If you need a scholarly article, use DartDoc.  DartDoc If there is a book or article you would like to read that is not available through Borrow Direct, you may request it from Dartmouth\u0026rsquo;s interlibrary loan program, known as DartDoc.1 To request an item, visit the DartDoc webpage, select the appropriate form (article, book, book chapter, etc.), and send your request electronically to the office. Staff will request your item from another library, who will ship the book to our library through the mail. If you are requesting a book chapter or article, the donor library will send you a .pdf free of charge to your DartDoc account. Make sure to download the .pdf to your computer as they disappear after a period of time.\n   If you are ordering a physical book, DartDoc is the slowest option. Requests may take up to two weeks to be fulfilled.\n   Due to Covid-19, the library will be using DartDoc to give you access to books and book chapters that you need while away from campus. While I am sure that they will do the best they can, there is likely to be a longer wait for these items than if you just walked into the library and got it yourself. This puts you at something of a disadvantage, so you will have to be crafty.\n   Recall Request If a book is owned by our library, but checked out by another patron, you have one final option: a recall request. If a book is currently on loan, its catalog entry will contain a link that you may use to request a recall of the book. After your initiate a recall, the patron who has borrowed the book will receive a notice that they must return it.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t recommend using recall requests for two reasons. First, it is considered something of a researcher\u0026rsquo;s faux pas to do so. Some researchers, angered by a recall, have been known to counter by returning the book and then immediately recalling it right back from you.2 These are the petty games Ph.Ds play, and we play for keeps. Secondly, the patron will have up to two weeks to return the book in question. That is likely far too long for you to wait. Using Borrow Direct will almost always be a quicker path to your prized tome.\nWorkshop  Visit Borrow Direct and familiarize yourself with the service. Create a login for DartDoc and explore the service. Order a book if you like. It\u0026rsquo;s free.    One of my biggest pet peeves about Dartmouth is our absurd need to re-brand everything to make it \u0026ldquo;Dartmouthy.\u0026rdquo; Hence, \u0026ldquo;interlibrary loan\u0026rdquo;\u0026mdash;a term comprehensible to everyone who has ever been to a library\u0026mdash;is replaced with something completely alienating, like \u0026ldquo;Dart-Doc.\u0026rdquo; It is madness.

These textbooks present academic research as an orderly list of procedures and tasks, each one leading logically to the next, culminating in a superbly crafted essay. This narrative generally begins with the formulation of a research question, proceeds to the gathering of background information and secondary sources, and finally to the drafting, revision, and completion of the project.\nThe problem is that research just doesn\u0026rsquo;t work this way.\nThe narrative of the research process found in books is misleading because it presents an idealized and simplified description of how a project comes to be, develops, and concludes. The truth of the matter is that academic research is rarely a logical, linear operation. And a list of steps can never fully prepare a researcher for the nature of true inquiry. Research is a surprising, exhilarating, and fulfilling experience, but it is also a messy, recursive, and frequently frustrating one. When students try research for themselves and experience difficulty and confusion instead of an orderly march to success, they often feel as if they aren\u0026rsquo;t good enough or smart enough to do research. So if you feel confused and overwhelmed at moments, you should know that is perfectly normal and you\u0026rsquo;re doing just fine.\n The most important keys for success are consistent effort over time, determination, organization, and knowing when to ask for help.  With that stated, what I describe below presents a set of steps virtually identical to what I\u0026rsquo;ve just criticized. The difference is that I won\u0026rsquo;t pretend that following a list of procedures will somehow magically produce an exemplary research essay. Every project is different and requires something different from the researcher. To be successful requires a lot of hard work, creativity, inspiration, and help from others. These complexities are impossible to capture in a checklist or manual of procedures.\nResearch (like many things in life) is something that you must do in order to learn and practice in order to improve. Mistakes and confusion are great teachers if we are patient with them\u0026mdash;they help reveal the limits of our knowledge and the horizon of our skills. Over time, and with experience, you will gain better research instincts. It is important to try on your own, but it is nice to have someone you can ask for help from when things get really tough. I am honored to be your person. And there are many others at the library who are happy to help who have specialized training that far exceeds my own.\nWhat is Research Writing? Research writing involves a number of important skills: library research, critical thinking, the evaluation of sources, and the ability to synthesize information through summary, paraphrase, and quotation. Although synthesizing the thinking of others is an important part of the research essay, in its true form the research essay strives for much more than a mere restatement of what others have said on a particular topic or question. As Jack Baker and Allen Brizee state:\n A research paper is not simply an informed summary of a topic by means of primary and secondary sources. It is neither a book report nor an opinion piece nor an expository essay consisting solely of one\u0026rsquo;s interpretation of a text nor an overview of a particular topic. Instead, it is a genre that requires one to spend time investigating and evaluating sources with the intent to offer interpretations of the texts, and not unconscious regurgitations of those sources. The goal of a research paper is not to inform the reader what others have to say about a topic, but to draw on what others have to say about a topic and engage the sources in order to thoughtfully offer a unique perspective on the issue at hand.\n In high school you were perhaps asked to write research papers on predetermined topics. These essays were probably not what Baker and Brizee have in mind. Your projects were likely just reports\u0026mdash;retellings of what other scholars or writers have said on a topic. A true research essay involves blazing a new path of inquiry where you produce original ideas, questions, and arguments. A research paper is a contribution to an ongoing conversation, a moment when you engage in dialogue with other important voices about a topic that you value.\nThe Academic Conversation It is helpful to imagine a research essay as taking part in an ongoing conversation. Unlike the dialogue that we have with most people in our lives, these scholarly conversations occur in print\u0026mdash;within published, peer-reviewed books and journal articles. Some conversations are vibrant, with hundreds or even thousands of participants. Other conversations are small, involving but a few specialists. Many conversations have been going on for hundreds or even thousands of years, while other conversations have only just started. Virtually everything you might write or think about is already part of one or more of these conversations. So, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t know it at the time, when you write about anything you are entering a conversation that already exists.\nLike any good conversationalist, the author of a research paper wants to contribute his or her thoughts and opinions for the consideration of others in the conversation. But if you want to be taken seriously in the conversation, you have to know what the debates are about, who is involved in the dialogue, and what has been said previously. In short, you must remain mindful that your ideas have a context. This is why research is important: it is how you come to understand what has already been said and by whom.\nThe moves you make in these conversations will take many forms. We might, for example, take the idea of one scholar and build on it in some way\u0026mdash;perhaps by extending it to a new context. Or, we might offer a new interpretation of the meaning of a particular film, historical event, or scientific experiment, distinguishing our view from the ones that already exist. During this process of articulating our own views, we often find ourselves in conflict with the thinking of others. As a result, we will often contribute to the conversation by expressing the reasons why we disagree in part or in whole with one or more of the other individuals in the conversation. On the other hand, we may also choose to bring in some ideas or words from others that we find helpful in making our own case. But, critically, our writing should never be a mere rehashing of someone else\u0026rsquo;s work. In any case, we must remain mindful that the conversation we hope to take part in existed before we entered it, and that whatever we might say or argue has a context that must be considered. Thus, every academic paper you write will not only argue an original point or idea, it will also show how that idea emerges from an existing conversation.\nThe Research \u0026ldquo;Process\u0026rdquo; Step 1: Find a research question you would like to investigate Discovering your own research topic can be an overwhelming experience. With so many things to choose from, finding a narrow focus is often difficult. However, before you can truly begin your library research you need to find a way to narrow your field of inquiry to a small set of research questions or problems.\n Why do I like football? - This is an opinion or feeling that can't be proven or falsified with research.   Is football is a sport? - This is a statement of fact that requires only the most minimal research to verify.  []() Which football positions have the highest risk for CTE (Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy) and why? - This is a question that will require research, testing, and data-gathering. --- As you begin your research, try to keep an open mind and allow yourself to be pulled in new directions. It is important to think of the research process as something more than a mere attempt to find information on a predetermined topic or an effort to find evidence that supports an idea or belief that one already holds, an error commonly referred to as confirmation bias. Instead, research should be process of discovery where you encounter ideas and contemplate questions that you would have otherwise never imagined.\nResearch, done properly, has the power to change us\u0026mdash;altering our views, values, and sense of things. But you must first allow yourself to become vulnerable to new ideas and follow the evidence, wherever it goes. During any particular research project you should be prepared to change your mind and your focus many, many times. You will frequently encounter dead ends; but you will also experience the thrill of serendipitous discovery that will take you down a path you would have never considered.\n Step 2: Generate some keywords that are relevant to your topic Library searching is done by querying databases with a set of keywords. Perhaps the most critical first step in research is to create a list of keywords that you associate with your question, problem, or topic. These keywords will be used during your initial searches in the library\u0026rsquo;s catalog and databases.\nInventing good keywords often requires some metacritical thinking (thinking about your thinking). And you may need to ask someone who already knows a lot about your subject to help you with selecting your keywords. Searching with improper keywords will leave you with the impression that there is nothing in the library on your topic, which is almost certainly not the case.\n To put things bluntly, if your keywords suck you will not find good sources.  Significantly, you may not be able to determine the best keywords for searching until you\u0026rsquo;ve stumbled into some good sources and use them to help you refine your search keywords. For example, a student may search the catalog to find out how nations spy on their citizens by analyzing their social media accounts. Using the word \u0026ldquo;spy\u0026rdquo; turns out not to be the best keyword; the keyword \u0026ldquo;surveillance\u0026rdquo; was far more productive. And as her knowledge grew, the student began using the names of specific countries and the names of their security agencies as keywords. So, as your knowledge deepens and you gain more insight into your chosen topic, you will constantly refine your keywords to cast more light into the darker regions of the library\u0026rsquo;s holdings. Research is an iterative, accretive process\u0026mdash;not a linear one.\n Step 3: Search for Books and Periodicals The library uses special software designed to augment the searching of the library\u0026rsquo;s holdings known as a \u0026ldquo;discovery layer.\u0026rdquo; Dartmouth currently uses a discovery layer product known as Primo. While Primo will apply your keywords to the library catalog to show the physical holdings the library has on site, it will simultaneously search subscription electronic databases containing journal articles, newspapers, magazines, and other media.\nAfter you submit your search terms in the field, these items are organized by relevance, as determined by an algorithm. After entering your keywords you will notice ways to further refine your search by clicking on several options on the left pane of the window. To limit your search to books only, select Format \u0026gt; Books on the left side of the page under \u0026ldquo;Refine Your Results.\u0026rdquo; Or limit the search to peer-reviewed articles by selecting Show Only \u0026gt; Peer-Reviewed Content and Format \u0026gt; Articles. There are many further ways to refine your searches in this way, if desired.\n🔴️ WARNING about Primo  A word of caution about Primo: while it searches the library catalog it its entirety, it does not search all of the electronic databases to which Dartmouth has a subscription. This means that if you exclusively use Primo for your searches, you will miss out on potentially vast amounts of possible sources that could be discovered through searching the various databases individually.   Step 4a: Use subject headings to systematically survey your topic Your initial keyword searches will lead to a number of books that are useful to you, but there are limits to keyword searching. It is often inefficient and inexact. This is why the Library of Congress assigns a series of subject headings and subheadings to every copyrighted book. These subject headings are an example of what is known as a controlled vocabulary in library and information science. Every book is placed within the system of categorization which means that once you find the subject headings and subheadings that are relevant to your research, you can easily find every book published on your topic. This is extremely useful as it allows for a systematic examination of your topic rather than the hodgepodge efforts through keyword searches.\n  You can download .pdfs of all the Library of Congress subject headings on their website.\n  Or you can browse the list of subject headings by searching their catalog. Choose \u0026ldquo;SUBJECTS containing\u0026rdquo; from the dropdown menu and enter a keyword. This will reveal every subject heading related to the topic you entered.\n  Step 4b: Use subject headings to find closely related books Perhaps the most helpful thing about subject headings is they are an easy means of finding additional (and closely related) sources on your topic once you have acquired one. For example, if you discover that historian Alan Taylor\u0026rsquo;s1 book The Civil War of 1812 is an important source for your research project, you can use the book\u0026rsquo;s subject headings to find all of the other books written on those topics in your library. As you may see from this example, the Library of Congress assigned the book the following three subject headings:\n   Click to see the books on these subjects held by our library:   1. United States--History--War of 1812--Social aspects\n  2. Ontario--History--War of 1812--Social aspects\n  3. Northern boundary of the United States--History--19th century\n   In most library catalogs these subject headings are hyperlinked; clicking on any of them leads you to a list of every other book in the library that shares that particular subject heading. Thus, if your research interest is the social aspects of the War of 1812, you can quickly find every other book the library owns on that subject by merely clicking on the hyperlinked subject heading in the catalog. Note, however, that clicking on the subject heading will only give you the books that your library owns, not the full universe of books. For that, you must do a subject heading search at the Library of Congress or a service like WorldCat.\n Step 5: Read background information on your topic Since your research process will cause you to encounter a variety of unfamiliar terms, theories, people, and events, you will frequently need to stop your research and read background or reference materials to shore up your understanding. Much of the scholarship you will read is written with an audience in mind who already possess a great deal of knowledge about the topic. These writings will often refer to things in an offhanded way, trusting that the audience already knows the jargon or information in question. This can be a somewhat alienating experience for a novice in the field. For that reason, we have reference works to help orient ourselves in these critical conversations.\nThus, a research project should always involve the reading of general reference materials about the topic. Before you can ask an intelligent question about your topic or contribute to an ongoing scholarly conversation, you need to develop a working knowledge of basic facts to serve as a foundation for your project. The best way to develop this basic understanding is to examine peer-reviewed reference works such as encyclopedias, biographies, dictionaries, and other forms of reference material.\nBaker-Berry library has a number of helpful reference resources in this regard. If you visit the Library Reference Resources link in the Library\u0026rsquo;s Research Guides, you will find an impressive array of organized reference materials like bibliographies, encyclopedias, and dictionaries. Most of them are fully digitized and do not even require a trip to the library. Always start your research project with reference works and gain a basic grounding of your topic before developing your research question or thesis. For example, before you begin an essay on Iraqi feminism in the 1960s, you should read the Wikipedia article on the modern history of Iraq to get a broad sense of the context you are entering with your writing. Other helpful background information aids of note:\n Wikipedia, CIA World Factbook, Oxford Reference Online, Britannica Online.  A word of warning about Wikipedia (and internet sources in general): it has not been through a process of scholarly peer-review. For that reason, it is unwise to rely on Wikipedia as a source for a research project. Use Wikipedia to gain background information on your topic and lead you to other authoritative sources, but when it comes time to write your essay, use a peer-reviewed source.\nStep 6: Perform citation chases 2 Many students will find a book or article that is perfect for their research project, do a celebration dance, and then return to the library catalog to use keyword searches to find more sources like it. But consider that the source you hold in your hand was substantially built from other sources that are cited in the bibliography. Look at the source again: it is now a treasure map that may lead to untold riches.\nWhen you discover books and articles that are relevant to your project, perform what is known as a \u0026ldquo;citation chase.\u0026rdquo; This involves examining the bibliography of the book, article, or chapter, looking for other relevant items. Find these related sources in the library and then repeat the process again. Performing a citation chase is often the best way of discovering other sources connected to your research focus\u0026mdash;far better than using keyword searches.\n Some databases, such as the multidisciplinary Web of Science, perform these citation chases automatically.

There is probably no more powerful insight in performing research. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   "});index.add({'id':51,'href':'/resources/open-handbook/keyword-index/','title':"Keyword Index",'content':"Keyword Index This is a running list of the academic keywords and internal links within this text.\n   Keyword Links     Altering Sources C8   Analysis C1, C6   Annotation C1   Archiving Work C4   Argument C6   Audience C3   Brackets [ ] C8   Chicago Style C11   Close Reading C1   Citation/Documentation C11   Ellipsis \u0026hellip; C8   Grammar C13   Highlighting C1   MLA Style C11   Note-taking C2   Organization C4, C7   Paragraphs C7   Paraphrase C8   Patchwriting C10   Peer Review WS, C13   Plagiarism C7   Quotation C8   Research C12   Response C6   Signal Phrase C8   Sources C8, C9, C11   Summary C8    "});index.add({'id':52,'href':'/resources/open-handbook/chapter-11-mla/','title':"MLA Documentation Style",'content':"MLA Style  MLA document formatting When setting up your word processor for an MLA-formatted document, use the following settings to format your page:\nMLA Page Formatting   Set one-inch margins on all sides of the document.\n  Double-space the entire document, including block quotes.\n  In the top left portion of the first page, type your name, instructor\u0026rsquo;s name, course title, and date on separate, double-spaced lines.\n  Include your last name and a page number on each page in the top right corner of the header.\n  Include a centered title on the first page.\n  Indent the first line of each paragraph with a tab set to 1/2 inch.\n  Example:     MLA requires a bibliography at the conclusion of the essay that includes the full citation of the sources cited within the essay. In MLA the bibliography is known as the Works Cited page. When formatting a Works Cited page, use the following rules:\nMLA Works Cited page formatting    Center the words \u0026ldquo;Works Cited\u0026rdquo; at the top of the page.\n  Use your last name and the page number on the right side of the page\u0026rsquo;s header.\n  Double space the entries.\n  Alphabetize the entries by the author\u0026rsquo;s last name.\n  If an entry runs more than one typed line, indent the second (and any subsequent) line with a 1/2-inch tab.\n  If two or more works by the same author are used, list the entries alphabetically by title. After the first entry, replace the author\u0026rsquo;s name with three dashes followed by a period.\n  Example:     When a quotation runs more than four typed lines, use a block quote. A block quote is a freestanding block of quoted words, set apart from the rest of the text. When formatting block quotes in MLA, use the following rules:\nMLA Block Quote Formatting    Begin the block quote on a new line.\n  Indent every line of the quote 1 inch from the left margin (this should be two tabs).\n  Do not use quotation marks around the quoted material.\n  Place the parenthetical citation after the final punctuation of the quoted passage.\n  Example:     MLA in-text citations The MLA style uses parenthetical citations within a document to indicate the author and page number of sources. Each time a source is used in your text, the author\u0026rsquo;s name and the page number of the source are placed in a parenthesis within your document. These in-text citations correspond to a full bibliographic entry for the source located in the essay\u0026rsquo;s Works Cited page at the conclusion of the essay.\nMLA In-text Citations  The MLA style parenthetical citations primarily take two forms:\n1. One form is used when the source you are citing is named or understood by your audience:\n According to scholar James Frey, \u0026ldquo;Each American consumes five pounds of ice cream annually\u0026rdquo; (78).\n  In this first sentence the author is specifically named. If the author is clear from the context, only the page number must be placed within the parenthetical citation.  2. The other form is used when the author being cited is unknown or unclear based on the context:\n Researchers have reported that \u0026ldquo;Each American consumes five pounds of ice cream annually\u0026rdquo; (Frey 78).\n  In the second example the student author uses a generic term \u0026ldquo;researchers\u0026rdquo; that does not help identify a specific source or author; as a result, the student has included Frey\u0026rsquo;s name in the citation to indicate whose research is being referenced.  The in-text citations described above will comprise virtually all of your citations. However, there are a few circumstances when the in-text citations will require a different approach.\n3. For media that has a runtime\u0026mdash;like film, television, or music\u0026mdash;MLA now requires that you cite a timestamp within your in-text citations. Use colons to separate hours, minutes, and seconds. For example, this citation is of a film:\n According to Rushmore Academy\u0026rsquo;s headmaster, Max is \u0026ldquo;probably the worst student\u0026rdquo; at the school (04:04-07).\n or\n In \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t Hurt Yourself,\u0026rdquo; Beyoncé proclaims \u0026ldquo;I am the dragon breathing fire\u0026rdquo; (01:13-15).\n 4. For citations when the author is unknown, use an abbreviated version of the work\u0026rsquo;s title in the parenthetical citation. If no page number is available (for example, if the source was found on the web), just use the abbreviated title in the citation and provide the full bibliographic entry in the Works Cited page:\n Accordingly, the moose population in New Hampshire is suffering from the increased tick population (\u0026ldquo;Not Moosing Around\u0026rdquo;).\n 5. If the source was written by a corporate author, you may use the name of the company, government office, or organization who published the piece in place of the author:\n Scientists declare that this will be the hottest year on record (NOAA 234).\n   The MLA core elements The eighth edition of the MLA Handbook, published in 2016, issued sweeping changes to the formatting of the MLA bibliography. The previous seven editions of the handbook\u0026mdash;stretching back to the 1930s\u0026mdash;attempted to provide a model citation for every type of source. However, the explosion of internet-based sources and new forms of communication and media made the project of providing guidance on every type of source extremely challenging.\nThe new handbook replaces the creation of an ever-growing list of source types with a set of universal guidelines that may be used to formulate a citation for any type of source. These guidelines are referred to as the \u0026ldquo;core elements.\u0026rdquo; The promise of this new approach is that it provides a method for citing any type of source, even those that do not yet exist.\nUsing the core elements  The MLA core elements below are listed in the order they should appear in your own bibliography. The proper punctuation that should follow each element is also provided. Thus, you will begin the entry with the author(s) name, followed by a period. Then the title of the work will be provided, followed by a period. Then the title of the container, followed by a comma. And so on. If one of these core elements does not apply to your source, skip it and move to the next one until you have been through the entire list of elements.\n   Core Element Concluding Punctuation     Author .   Title .   Title of container (self contained if book) ,   Other contributors (translators or editors) ,   Version (edition) ,   Number (vol. and/or no.) ,   Publisher ,   Publication Date ,   Location (pages, paragraphs URL or DOI) .    Some sources have multiple containers  Note that some sources will have more than one container. If so, you will have to proceed through the second table listed below (adding it to the end of the entry you made using the table above) to complete your bibliographic entry:\n   Core Element Concluding Punctuation     2nd container\u0026rsquo;s title ,   Other contributors (translators or editors) ,   Version ,   Number ,   Publisher ,   Publication date ,   Location ,   Date of Access (if needed) .    Using the MLA core elements 1. Author. The first element of a citation is the author\u0026rsquo;s name. Since the MLA bibliography is organized alphabetically by the author\u0026rsquo;s last name, begin your citations with the author\u0026rsquo;s last name followed by a comma, then the author\u0026rsquo;s first name. If a middle name or initial are supplied, include those after the first name in the entry. Conclude the author element with a period. Sources will often have multiple authors. In that case, only the first listed author will use the Last Name, First Name structure. For example:\nTaylor, Alan. A Tour of New Hampshire\u0026rsquo;s Wolf Trees. Little and Sons, 1998. Greely, Fred, Mary Jones, and Rick Flair. There\u0026rsquo;s a Bat in My Attic: Struggles with the New Hampshire Brown Bat. Wildlife Press, 2012.  2. Title of source. The title of a source is italicized if it is considered \u0026ldquo;self-contained\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;independent.\u0026rdquo; Sources that are part of a larger whole, however, are placed in quotation marks. For example, a book is a self-contained and independent source; however, a chapter in a book is part of a larger whole. Thus, the title of the book will be italicized while the title of the chapter will appear in quotation marks. Similarly, a television series is an independent whole, so its title will be italicized. However, an episode within the television series is part of the larger program, so its title appears in quotations. For example:\nSan, Rathanak. Escaping Vietnam. Peach Publishing, 1988. Taylor, James. \u0026ldquo;The Indian Matter of Charles Brockden Brown\u0026rsquo;s Writings.\u0026quot; American Literature, vol. 45, no. 6, 1998, pp. 432-45. \u0026ldquo;Say My Name.\u0026quot; Breaking Bad, created by Vince Gilligan, performance by Brian Cranston, season 5, episode 7, AMC, 2012.  MLA has a standardized approach to the capitalization of titles. Regardless of how the title appears on a title page, scholarly journal, or database, use the following information to properly capitalize the title of your source on your Works Cited page:\n  Capitalize nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and subordinating conjunctions.\n  Unless they begin the title, do not capitalize articles, prepositions, coordinating conjunctions, or the \u0026ldquo;to\u0026rdquo; in infinitive verbs.\n   3. Title of container, Many kinds of sources are smaller parts of larger wholes. MLA refers to these larger wholes as containers. For example, a chapter is a smaller part of a book. In this sense, the book is the container for the chapter. Similarly, a scholarly article is a smaller part of the scholarly journal that contains it. Newspaper articles, essays in a collection, and television episodes are all contained by a larger whole. These containers are italicized in your bibliography. For example, here are the citations for an article in a scholarly journal and a work in a collection of essays:\nTaylor, James. \u0026ldquo;The Indian Matter of Charles Brockden Brown\u0026rsquo;s Writings.\u0026rdquo; American Literature, vol. 45, no. 6, 1998, pp. 432-45. Cranston, William. \u0026ldquo;My Famous Donkey.\u0026rdquo; Short Stories of East Tennessee, edited by Jax Ridley, East Tennessee State P, 2011, pp. 77-90. Some sources have multiple containers. This is often true for electronic sources. For example, a scholarly article may be contained by both the journal that originally published it and the academic research database that hosts it online. Consider an article published in the academic database called JSTOR:\nTaylor, James. \u0026ldquo;The Indian Matter of Charles Brockden Brown\u0026rsquo;s Writings.\u0026rdquo; American Literature, vol. 45, no. 6, 1998, pp. 432-45. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/8759038475. When citing a source make sure that you represent every container so as to truly represent where that source was discovered.\n 4. Other contributors, Your sources will often have a number of other individuals who contributed to the work besides the author(s). You may find sources with one or more of these additional roles:\n  director\n  editor\n  illustrator\n  introducer\n  narrator\n  performer\n  translator\n   5. Version, Many sources are published in more than one version. The most common version you will encounter in academic research is a new version of a book. Each new version of a book is described as an edition. These versions are numbered in sequential order: 1st edition, 2nd edition, 3rd edition, and so on. There are other kinds of versions, some of which are illustrated below.\nAnderson, Wes. Rushmore. 1998. Performance by Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman, director\u0026rsquo;s cut, Buena Vista International, 2017. The Bible. Authorized King James Version, Oxford UP, 1998. David, Gray. Blister in the Sun: A Day in the Life of an Aging Rock Star. Revised ed., Primer Publishing, 1993. Smith, John. Raising Arizona. 3rd ed., Primer Publishing, 1993. Always ensure that you cite the exact version that you use in your writing. Pagination often differs between editions; versions of a film or other media may vary significantly or have additional content. Failing to cite the specific version of a text will lead to confusion and may make your readers feel that you are sloppy or uncaring.\n 6. Number, Many sources are part of a numbered sequence. For the most part you will encounter this in journal articles and books that are part of a numbered series.\nJournal articles are often collected together in volumes and numbered issues:\nTaylor, James. \u0026ldquo;The Indian Matter of Charles Brockden Brown\u0026rsquo;s Writings.\u0026rdquo; American Literature, vol. 45, no. 6, 1998, pp. 432-45. Some journals do not collect issues into numbered volumes; instead, they only publish numbered issues:\nClampers, Smitty. \u0026ldquo;Genocide in South America.\u0026rdquo; Journal of Violence, no. 7, 1990, pp. 221-75. When books are too large to be published as a single text, they are organized in volumes:\nSmith, Jeb. A History of American Serial Killers. Vol. 6, Samford UP, 2012.  7. Publisher, A publisher is the business or organization responsible for bringing a book, article, website, or other type of source to the public. Books will commonly indicate the publisher on the title or copyright pages, which will be the first few pages of the text:\nLund, Frank. The Gravest of Errors. Indiana UP, 2012. Websites or blogs may not have clear indications for the publisher. However, this information is often included in the footer at the bottom of a homepage or on \u0026ldquo;About\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;Contact\u0026rdquo; pages:\nTeeter, Graham. \u0026ldquo;My Time Alone in Vietnam, a Travel Tale.\u0026rdquo; Narratives from the Edge, Society of World Geographers and Adventurers, www.edgenarratives.com/teeter. Television series and films are often created by a large array of producers and companies. However, cite only the organization that had the primary responsibility for production:\nAnderson, Wes. Rushmore. Performance by Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman, Buena Vista International, 1998. The MLA stylebook explains several situations where a publisher\u0026rsquo;s name is not required in the citation:\n  A periodical (academic journal, newspaper, magazine, etc.)\n  A work published by its author.\n  A website whose title is essentially the name of the publisher.\n  A website that does not help produce the source, only host it (academic database, YouTube, etc.)\n  Be careful, however, to include things like the electronic database name or platforms like YouTube as containers, described above.\n 8. Publication date, Most sources appropriate for academic research will clearly disclose the date, or dates, of publication. This information will often appear in the front matter of books or journals, or in the masthead of newspapers.\nOnline sources, however, present a problem. Sometimes it is unclear when an online source was published. Other times the online source may be a digital version of a print source which may have been published at a different time.\nWhen a source has more than one publication date, cite only the version that you are using in your own writing. For example, if you are citing a newspaper article you read online, you should cite the date disclosed on the online version, not the corresponding print version. Failing to do this may cause problems if the online version was edited after the newspaper went to print.\n 9. Location, The location of a source largely refers to a source\u0026rsquo;s page number, or numbers. However, many types of sources do not have page numbers. A web page\u0026rsquo;s location, for example, is a URL. And a painting or some other artwork\u0026rsquo;s location would be the physical location of the museum where you viewed it in person.\n  A chapter in a book:\nTate, Justin. \u0026ldquo;Ordering Wine in Paris.\u0026rdquo; An American\u0026rsquo;s Guide to French Cuisine, U of Tennessee P, 1989, pp. 45-61.   If the source is only on a single page, use p. rather than pp. to indicate the page number.\n  A website:\nGrisham, Wyatt. \u0026ldquo;A Soccer Mom\u0026rsquo;s Lament.\u0026rdquo; Sports and Parenting, 28 Oct. 2017, www.sandp.org/soccermomslament.   URLs can be challenging to present because of their length or mutable nature. If possible, use what is known as a \u0026ldquo;stable url\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;permalink\u0026rdquo;\u0026mdash;a permanent URL associated with online content. These permalinks will not change over time. You may also find online content with a DOI, a digital object identifier. You may cite this DOI in place of a URL. If a URL is too long to include in your bibliography, you may use a shortened version of the URL by citing the domain name of the source (for example: www.nytimes.com).\n A material object or work of art:  Wayins, Brill. Lone Pine Tree. 2001, Hood Museum of Art, Hanover.\nNote: In previous versions of the style, MLA required the city of the publisher to be included. This is no longer a requirement of the style.\n  The MLA bibliography While the new edition of the MLA Handbook largely dispenses with specific templates for making citations, I have retained the following examples for this edition of the Open Handbook. I find that these examples are still a helpful guide, especially for students who lack experience with this style of citation.\nThe following section provides examples for citing sources that are commonly found in academic writing. The various forms have been organized into sections on books, periodicals, electronic sources, and other types of sources that are less common.\nCiting Books Book Forms  A book by one author: Taylor, Herman. A Tale of One City. Little and Sons, 1998.  Two or more works by the same author(s): San, Rathanak. Escaping Vietnam. Peach Publishing, 1988. - - -. The Golden Triangle. Gray and Long, 1999.  If you cite two works by the same author, use the author\u0026rsquo;s first and last name in the first instance. Use three dashes followed by a period in place of the author\u0026rsquo;s name for any additional works. Place the works in alphabetical order using the first important word in the title.   Two or three authors: Roberts, John, Philip Glass and Jane Hinds. Recovering the City of Boston. U of Massachusetts P, 2000.  Cite the first author using the typical Last Name, First Name format. For each subsequent author, use First Name Last Name.   Four or more authors: Bankston, Jonathan, et al. On Barns. Woodcraft Publishing, 2013.  If a work has four or more authors, you may give the first author\u0026rsquo;s name and replace the other authors with the Latin term \u0026ldquo;et al,\u0026rdquo; which means \u0026ldquo;and others.\u0026rdquo;   A book with an editor: James, Henry. Portrait of a Lady. Edited by Leon Edel, Houghton, 1963.  If a work has multiple editors, use \u0026ldquo;Editors\u0026rdquo; followed by the editors' names in the order they are listed in the source.   An edition (other than the first): Thompson, Fred. Why I Fight. 3rd ed., Vanity Publications, 2000. A republished book: James, Esther. My Life. 1946. Random House, 2001.  A republished book is one that was previously published in a different form, perhaps even from a different publisher. For books of this kind, indicate the original year of publication after the title.   Corporate author (written by organization or government): John Bigam Society. The Religions of Kenya. Nairobi Publishing, 2000. United States, Department of Transportation. State Highway Signage Regulations. Government Publishing Office, 2002.  If the author of a work is a government or institution, use the name of that organization in place of the author. If the text is the publication of a government, include the name of the department or agency.   An anthology: Foner, Eric, editor. An American Voice: A Collection of America\u0026rsquo;s Finest Essays. McKinley and Smith, 2011.  Work in an anthology or collection of essays: Graves, Thomas. \u0026ldquo;The History of our National Anthem.\u0026rdquo; An American Voice: A Collection of America\u0026rsquo;s Finest Essays, edited by Eric Foner, McKinley and Smith, 2011, pp. 20-41.  No author or editor: A Guide to Boston. Beantown Publishing, 2000.  Forward, introduction, preface, or afterward: Knox, John. Introduction. The Life of James, by Elders Johnson, Random House, 2009, pp. 1-8.  A book with a translator: McDougle, Astrid. The Basics of Gaelic. Translated by Paddy Maloney, Vintage, 1990.  Multivolume work: Graves, Johanna. Ronald Reagan and the Iran-Contra Affair. Vol. 7, Greenstalk Publishers, 1988.  Book in a series: Smith, Rod. American Economic Expansion in the Nineteenth Century. Edited by Andrew Stills, Alfred A. Knopf, 1988. History of American Economic Development.  Occasionally, a press will publish a series of books about a single topic. If your source is a book in a published series, indicate the name of the series at the conclusion of the citation.   Dictionary or encyclopedia entry: \u0026ldquo;Suzerian.\u0026rdquo; Merriam-Webster\u0026rsquo;s Collegiate Dictionary. 10th ed., 2008.  If you are citing an entry from a reference text like a dictionary or encyclopedia that is organized alphabetically, you do not need to indicate the page number.   Sacred text: The Bible. Authorized King James Version, Oxford UP, 1998.  If you are citing a particular edition of a sacred text, such as the Bible, Koran, or Torah, include that information.   Book with title within the title: Hixson, Fred. On Cormac McCarthy\u0026rsquo;s Blood Meridian. Plainspeak P, 2000.  If a book title contains the title of another book or article, remove the italics to indicate the title of the other work.

Student writers are often able to write sentences well in their own voice but have difficulty when they try to weave the voices of others into their prose. I also find that most students have developed a particular strategy or formula for quotation that they use over and over again as a kind of crutch. This structure resembles the following:\n According to Dr. Taylor, “all your quotes are made the same way” (89).\n This sentence is correct in every way. However, it is important to develop some flexibility with respect to quotations. If you rely on a single strategy for quotation, your writing will be repetitive and bland. Further, you will often discover that the words you would like to quote will not easily fit into the structure illustrated above. Attempting to cram this borrowed language into your trusted, familiar structure will result in awkward and ungrammatical sentences. However, if you develop an ability to form sentences with a variety of sentence structures, you will never have this problem.\nMy guess is that most of you rely on this structure because you assume that the words of others must be presented in the precise order that they appear in the original. Part of becoming a better writer is understanding that you have the authority to chop up, reorder, and alter quotations to serve your purposes so long as you do not misrepresent the thinking or arguments of others.\nA few examples Let’s examine few examples based on this passage from George Orwell’s famous essay entitled “A Hanging”:\n It was about forty yards to the gallows. I watched the bare brown back of the prisoner marching in front of me. He walked clumsily with his bound arms, but quite steadily, with that bobbing gait of the Indian who never straightens his knees. At each step his muscles slid neatly into place, the lock of hair on his scalp danced up and down, his feet printed themselves on the wet gravel. And once, in spite of the men who gripped him by each shoulder, he stepped slightly aside to avoid a puddle on the path. It is curious, but till that moment I had never realized what it means to destroy a healthy, conscious man. When I saw the prisoner step aside to avoid the puddle, I sawt he mystery, the unspeakable wrongness, of cutting a life short when it is in full tide. This man was not dying, he was alive just as we were alive. All the organs of his body were working\u0026mdash;bowels digesting food, skin renewing itself, nails growing, tissues forming—all toiling away in solemn foolery. His nails would still be growing when he stood on the drop, when he was falling through the air with a tenth of a second to live. His eyes saw the yellow gravel and the grey walls, and his brain still remembered, foresaw, reasoned\u0026mdash;reasoned even about puddles. He and we were a party of men walking together, seeing, hearing, feeling, understanding the same world; and in two minutes, with a sudden snap, one of us would be gone\u0026mdash;one mind less, one world less. (47)\n The following sentences all express the same meaning; however, they use a variety of sentence structures to accomplish that goal:\n  “It is curious,” Orwell relates, as the hanging party approaches the gallows and the prisoner tries to avoid stepping in a puddle, “but till that moment I had never realized what it means to destroy a healthy, conscious man” (47).\n  Orwell finds it “curious” that it was only after viewing a condemned prisoner avoid getting wet on the way to his death that he “realized what it means to destroy a healthy, conscious man” (47).\n  Orwell reveals a “curious” truth: he “never realized what it means to destroy a healthy, conscious man” until he watched a condemned prisoner “[step] slightly aside to avoid a puddle” on the way to the gallows (47).\n  By moving “slightly aside to avoid a puddle,” a condemned man makes George Orwell suddenly realize a “curious” truth\u0026mdash;“what it means to destroy a healthy, conscious man” (47).\n  As the condemned man approaches the gallows and steps slightly aside to avoid a puddle, Orwell observes: “It is curious, but till that moment I had never realized what it means to destroy a healthy, conscious man” (47).\n  Workshop Exercise This second passage is taken from Richard Hofstadter’s famous essay entitled “The Paranoid Style in American Politics,” which was published in Harper’s Magazine in 1964. In the essay, Hofstadter analyzes the over-blown rhetoric and paranoid psychology of a certain political type:\n The paranoid spokesman sees the fate of conspiracy in apocalyptic terms—he traffics in the birth and death of whole worlds, whole political orders, whole systems of human values. He is always manning the barricades of civilization. He constantly lives at a turning point. Like religious millennialists he expresses the anxiety of those who are living through the last days and he is sometimes disposed to set a date for the apocalypse. (77)\n In the example sentence below, I have summarized the meaning of the passage. Rewrite this same meaning seven additional times, using a variety of sentences structures and quotations from the Hofstadter passage. It might be helpful to use some of my example sentences above for inspiration.\n Hofstadtler argues that the paranoid politician and the religious fundamentalist both have rhetorical excess and exaggeration in common (77).

While most students have some familiarity with keyword searching through the Google search engine, library catalogs and databases don\u0026rsquo;t work in the same way. To query databases effectively and efficiently, you need to be familiar with Boolean searches.\nKeyword searches often produce too many results to examine in a reasonable amount of time. Keyword searches also suffer from large volumes of irrelevant results. Rather than page through hundreds or thousands of search results or sift through unwanted ones, you can use what are known as Boolean searches to make your searches much more precise. Boolean searches use what are known as logical operators to form search strings that help you zero in on the content you seek.\nThe three most common logical operators are AND, OR, and NOT. However, you should also learn how to use exact phrases, truncation, and wildcards in search strings.\n Workshop Study the following information, then complete the problem sets.\n    Operator Purpose Example     AND Narrow a search by adding additional keywords Tom Hardy AND shirtless   OR Broaden a search by adding additional keywords Ohio OR Virginia   NOT Prune search results by removing certain keywords Vikings NOT football   \u0026quot;...\u0026quot; Return results containing an exact phrase \u0026ldquo;artificial intelligence\u0026rdquo;   * Truncation: used to capture all the word endings from a search term manufact*   ? Wildcard: Finds spelling variations organi?ation, wom?n    Boolean search examples These Boolean terms are described in more detail below:\nAND  Although it may seem counterintuitive, AND is used to narrow the number of sources you retrieve from a database. You can visualize the search of a large academic database or library catalog using the following diagram:\n  { linguistics AND cognitive AND childhood }\nIn the search depicted above, a student has requested articles that contain the subjects cognitive, linguistics, and childhood. This particular search will only retrieve articles that contain all three terms. This small subset of the larger subject sets is referenced by the arrow. All the information represented by the other portions of the three circles will be excluded. Thus, even if an article contains two of the three search terms, it will be excluded from the results.\n  OR  Unlike the AND operator, OR seeks to broaden a search, as in this example:\n  { Virginia OR Ohio }\nIn the search depicted above, a student has searched for the subjects Virginia OR Ohio. This search will return every article having the subject of Virginia as well as every article with the subject of Ohio. Unlike the AND search, where only articles containing both terms are returned in the search results, the OR search yields every source on both subjects regardless of whether those subjects appear together in the same source. As a consequence, the OR search will produce far more results.\n Since the OR operator lacks precision, it is most often used in parenthetical searches, described below.    NOT  The Boolean operator NOT is used to subtract or screen out topics or keywords that are unwanted within the search results.\n  { \u0026ldquo;alternative energy\u0026rdquo; NOT solar }\nIn the search depicted above, a student is researching alternative energy and wants to exclude any information dealing with solar energy. To remove all references to solar energy, the student has searched for \u0026ldquo;alternative energy,\u0026rdquo; but has removed any articles from the search results that contain the subject solar using the operator NOT.\nThe NOT operator is helpful when you find your search results are polluted with unwanted items. This is often a problem when two distinct things share the same name. For example, if you were researching the Norse explorers known as the Vikings, you might discover that your search results include unwanted information about the Minnesota Vikings football team. You can subtract these unwanted results by searching for Vikings NOT Minnesota or Vikings NOT football, for example.\nThis search uses quotation marks to form an exact phrase search, described below.    Advanced searching These Boolean operators can be used to create long, increasingly precise search strings when they are fortified with more advanced operators: parentheticals, exact phrases, and wildcards.\nParenthetical searches You can also use the various Boolean search terms in tandem using parenthetical constructions:\n  (Ohio OR Virginia) AND unemployment\n  (cognitive AND linguistics) NOT childhood\n  Such parenthetical searches follow the order of operations, like in math equations. In the first example, the search will first combine all the articles with the keyword of Ohio to all the articles with the keyword Virginia, creating a large collection of search results. Afterward, the keyword unemployment will be applied to that collection using the AND operator, yielding the final search results that look for sources dealing with unemployment in either Virginia and Ohio. Similarly, the second example creates a large collection of results that share the subjects cognitive and linguistics, then all the items having the term childhood are removed from the results.\n  Exact phrase searches  Most Internet search engines and library catalogs default to the AND operator when multiple terms are entered, even if it has not been typed by the user. For example, if you search for artificial intelligence, the search algorithm will actually use the search string artificial AND intelligence to produce your results. In some circumstances this may produce undesirable results. For example, we might imagine an article about the \u0026ldquo;intelligence\u0026rdquo; of using certain \u0026ldquo;artificial\u0026rdquo; sweeteners in food for children. This is not an article that is relevant for your project.\nTo avoid this problem, you can instruct your search engine to perform what is known as an exact phrase search. This is performed by placing quotation marks around the exact words you are searching for:\n \u0026ldquo;artificial intelligence\u0026rdquo; AND apocalypse  By searching for \u0026ldquo;artificial intelligence\u0026rdquo; your search results will only contain items that have that exact phrase within the document or title.\n  Truncation and wildcards    manufact* (truncation)\n  wom?n (wild card)\n  If you search for the terms steel AND manufacturing, your search results may not include results with the terms manufacturer, manufacture, manufactured, or manufactures. As a result, you may not discover articles or books that are important to your research. By truncating the word with an asterisk, however, you will gather all the relevant search results.\nSimilarly, if you only search for woman, you will potentially miss out on the all the texts that mention women or womyn. Or imagine that you are doing research on a certain type of organization. It would be wise to search for organi?ation, since much of the English-speaking world spells the word with an \u0026ldquo;s\u0026rdquo; instead of a \u0026ldquo;z\u0026rdquo; as we do here in the US. Without this, your research may become skewed to favor the literature on US-based institutions. However, using the wild card ? you will search all spellings simultaneously, gathering all the relevant results. The question mark wild card should be used to replace a single letter only.\nTo illustrate, look at these two searches on the JSTOR database:\n  Iraq AND manufacturing (14,863 results)\n  Iraq AND manufact* (30,868 results) 👀️\n    Problem Sets   You want to examine fictional portrayals of Arab-Israeli conflict. Create a Boolean search string to search the library catalog with.\n  Narrow the previous search by examining only fictional portrayals involving Israelis and Palestinians available in our library.\n  Find peer-reviewed sources that examine Herman Melville\u0026rsquo;s novel Moby Dick and the Cold War that were written between 1990 and 2000.\n  You are curious if there is any scholarship on fictional portrayals of pandemic disease.\n  You want to know if certain governments are using the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to spy on their citizens.\n  You are interested in female MMA fighters and want to know if there is any scholarship on this.\n  "});index.add({'id':55,'href':'/courses/workshops/peer-review/','title':"Student Peer Review",'content':"   Peer Review Work  Reflective Prologue Take a moment to reflect on your work. Consider the following questions and write answers to them at the conclusion of your essay draft. Please ensure that this reflective work appears in the essay draft you turn in to Canvas as well.\n What did you learn by writing this draft? What was the most challenging thing about creating this draft? What do you like most about this draft? What is this draft\u0026rsquo;s greatest weakness or problem? How do you plan to make this draft better? Do you have any specific things you\u0026rsquo;d like your reviewers to consider or help you with? Do you have any questions?  Step I: Make a basic outline Exchange essays with a partner. To begin, read your peer\u0026rsquo;s reflective work at the end of his or her essay. Try to keep these ideas in mind as you read your partner\u0026rsquo;s work.\nRead though the essay completely without making notations or comments. Afterward, construct a brief outline of your partner\u0026rsquo;s essay by listing the main idea contained in each paragraph. Your focus should be on the paper\u0026rsquo;s argumentative structure, so concentrate on identifying the essay\u0026rsquo;s thesis and the supporting claims. Approach each paragraph as if it were a single unit of meaning. What claim does it make? What is its purpose? Try, as best you can, to state the main idea of each paragraph in a single sentence. Take your time and try to do this as accurately as possible.\nThe radically simplified version of the essay that results from this process may help expose logical weaknesses or problems with organization; at the same time, a simplified outline often inspires new ideas for the revision or expansion of the essay.\n  If more than one claim is detected in a paragraph, it is often a sign that the paragraph lacks focus. Place all the claims you detect from a paragraph in the outline, but flag the paragraphs with multiple claims in a note to the author as they may require revision.\n  If the paragraph does not present an overtly argumentative claim of some sort, try to characterize its purpose in the essay. For example, a paragraph may provide background information to help the audience understand the context of the essay\u0026rsquo;s argument. Or perhaps the paragraph is an example or illustration of some idea expressed in a previous paragraph.\n  If there is no clear claim or purpose detectable in the paragraph, make a note of this confusion in the outline.\n  It is helpful if you number the paragraphs for ease of reference: P1, P2, and so on.\n   Example outline   P1. Introduction. Thesis: \u0026ldquo;The US government should immediately remove sanctions on Iran because the policy only hurts the Iranian people, not their leaders.\u0026rdquo;\n  P2. Background: Explains the historical background between Iran and the US for the audience.\n  P3. Claim 1: The sanctions policy has failed to have the desired effect since the current government is not only in power, but strengthened as a result.\n  P4. Claim 2: The negative effects of the sanctions fall on the citizens of Iran, not their leaders. (Evidence: Emotional description of suffering from lack of embargoed medicines).\n  P5. Claim 2 cont. (Evidence: Emotional description of suffering from lack of food and other basic necessities).\n  P6. Claim 3: Sanctions have caused Iran to move closer to our global competitors, which weakens the United States' position in the region.\n  P7. Claim 3 cont.: Tensions from sanctions have led to increased military spending by Iran, threatening to destabilize the fragile peace with our key allies in the region and enriching competitors Russia and China.\n  P8. Conclusion: Concludes by describing a possible future where the removal of sanctions help put Iran toward a more democratic future.\n  \n    Step II: Respond After you\u0026rsquo;ve outlined the essay\u0026rsquo;s arguments, try to offer several clear ideas on how the essay could be improved. Assuming most of you are working in Microsoft Word, you may use the comment feature to add your observations to the outline of your colleague\u0026rsquo;s essay.\nYou might consider some of the following for guidance or inspiration:\n  How is the introduction? Does it hook you? Are you captured by its allure and drawn irresistibly into the body of the paper? Or is it flat? Boring? Can you offer some suggestions on how to improve it?\n  How is the argument? What are the specific strengths of the argument? Does the argument seem to go wrong at some point? What could be added to make the argument stronger? Or should something be deleted? Is the evidence strong? Are you convinced? Or do you have a specific objection to something that the author should take note of in his/her revision?\n  How are the paragraphs? Do they have descriptive topic sentences that indicate the main point of the paragraph? Is each paragraph focused on a single idea? Or do they lack unity? Brainstorm with your peer to discover ideas for revising the paragraph.\n  How is the sentence-level writing? Are there any fantastic turns of phrase that are really praiseworthy? Are there grammatical errors? Do some sentences not make sense? Note each instance of this on the paper itself. Discuss each of the problem sentences\u0026mdash;explain why you think it fails to communicate effectively.\n  Are quotations integrated well? Are there problems with the integration of sources? Do the sentences with quotations make sense? Are they grammatical? Cited properly?\n  Is the paper organized? Is there a logical flow to the essay? Or are there abrupt shifts in ideas or topics that are confusing or hard to follow? Do the paragraphs seem to transition into each other well? Or are there sudden “leaps” between them?\n  Do you have questions? Is there something that you’d like to ask about why the author chose to write something in the way that he or she did? Are there any ambiguities that you need resolved before you can properly understand something in the paper?\n  What about the formal properties of the essay? Does the essay use MLA format incorrectly? Discuss what you think the error might be in your group. Use the handbook to find consensus.\n  What’s the big take-away?

Before books or articles are published, they experience a rigorous process of evaluation by at least three experts who have advanced training in the field of study in question. These \u0026ldquo;referees,\u0026rdquo; as they are known, review the work anonymously. This anonymity theoretically ensures a more honest appraisal of the work under consideration for publication. When it works as intended, this scholarly review helps eliminate factual errors and other problems before the works are published. Thus, peer-reviewed works are more trustworthy than other sources of information.\nDetermining if a source is peer reviewed For novice researchers, distinguishing peer-reviewed sources from other published information can be challenging. Perhaps the best advice is to use only sources that you located within the library system, rather than things you found with a search engine on the open internet. You are far more likely to encounter trustworthy sources this way. Of course, is is also frequently the case that excellent information may be found on the open web; in these cases, we must use our best judgment to determine if the source is trustworthy or not. If you are confused about a source, ask your professor or one of the research librarians for assistance in making a determination.\nQuick tests for peer review Here are a few test criteria that you may use to make a judgment call about whether a source has been peer reviewed:\n Scholarly, peer-reviewed books are often published by an academic press associated with a college or university of repute. These publishers will have names like: Yale University Press or Duke University Press. Scholarly, peer-reviewed articles are almost always written by credentialed scholars (often the text will contain the university affiliation of the professor/author/scientist). Scholarly articles and books always have a bibliography. Scholarly articles always contain citations and commonly have footnotes or endnotes. Generally speaking, if you can find the publication at the dentist’s office or on an airport magazine rack, then it isn’t scholarly or peer-reviewed. If the article contains advertisements, it is likely not scholarly.  How to find peer-reviewed sources Many periodical databases only contain peer-reviewed academic articles. A good example is JSTOR. Any article you find there will have been peer reviewed. Many other databases, such as Academic Search Complete, have search limiters that can be selected to ensure that the search results only contain peer-reviewed sources. Our own library catalog search engine provides the ability to limit the search to peer-reviewed books and periodicals.\nWorkshop "});index.add({'id':57,'href':'/courses/workshops/working-sources/','title':"Working with Sources",'content':"   Working with Sources Documentation, quotation, summary, paraphrase  Perhaps the most challenging aspect of academic writing is the integration of source materials. Students often imagine that the most difficult thing about using sources is learning how and when to use a citation. While accurately documenting sources is a vital aspect of any process of inquiry, citing the page number of a source is not the only skill that is required. You must also learn how to artfully use signal phrases to announce borrowed ideas or words and transition to another source or back to your own ideas. Further, the integration of the source may occur in many forms: summary, paraphrase, or quotation (and often a mix of all three). To do any of these well requires excellent reading comprehension skills and a metacritical awareness of when it is preferable to use one form of integration over another. That\u0026rsquo;s a lot to orchestrate and get right.\nThis workshop asks you to practice several key moves that are used in academic writing, all of which are described at length in the \u0026ldquo;Working with Sources\u0026rdquo; chapter of the Open Handbook. You will use a passage from Walker Percy\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;The Loss of the Creature\u0026rdquo; to complete the workshop, excerpted below.\nCompleting this assignment will in no way make you proficient at the integration of sources. It will, however, help you conceptualize how sources are included in academic writing and give you a sense of what you need to work on in the future.\nSource Text  -From Walker Percy, \u0026ldquo;The Loss of the Creature,\u0026rdquo; p. 47.\n Why is it almost impossible to gaze directly at the Grand Canyon under these circumstances and see it for what it is—as one picks up a strange object from one\u0026rsquo;s back yard and gazes directly at it? It is almost impossible because the Grand Canyon, the thing as it is, has been appropriated by the symbolic complex which has already been formed in the sightseer\u0026rsquo;s mind. Seeing the canyon under approved circumstances is seeing the symbolic complex head on. The thing is no longer the thing as it confronted the Spaniard; it is rather that which has already been formulated—by picture postcard, geography book, tourist folders, and the words Grand Canyon. As a result of this preformulation, the source of the sightseer\u0026rsquo;s pleasure undergoes a shift. Where the wonder and delight of the Spaniard arose from his penetration of the thing itself, from a progressive discovery of depths, patterns, colors, shadows, etc., now the sightseer measures his satisfaction by the degree to which the canyon conforms to the preformed complex.\n   Workshop   Use a signal phrase with the author’s name to introduce a quotation from this text and then cite according to MLA.

If you fail to properly document your sources, your readers will be unable to follow your research, validate your claims, or judge the quality of your argument. Furthermore, failing to properly cite a source (whether summarized, paraphrased, or quoted) opens you to the charge of plagiarism, a serious academic offense.\nScholars avoid plagiarism and give credit to the thinking and writing of others using a variety of citation formats, or “styles.” As you work to complete your degree in college you will encounter a number of these citation formats. In fact, each discipline has a preferred style. The humanities use MLA, psychology uses APA, history and other social sciences use Chicago. There are many others. As you begin to specialize in a particular field of study, you will be expected to use the citation style of your discipline.\nAlthough citation formats differ significantly, they all have two primary components: in-text citations and a bibliography. As the name suggests, in-text citations are used to reference the work of others within the text itself; the bibliography contains an ordered list of all the in-text citations contained within a piece of writing.\nMost students have constructed an MLA Works Cited page before they arrive at college. This assignment is designed to help you learn the Chicago style bibliography by taking advantage of your familiarity with the MLA style.\n Workshop MLA to Chicago style translation Take a few moments to scan though this student essay in the Chicago style.1 Familiarize yourself with the essay\u0026rsquo;s construction, noting especially how it differs from the MLA style essay. The following questions will help you notice some key features of the Chicago style:\n    How is the title page formatted compared to MLA?\n     Is there anything odd about the page numbering scheme?\n     Examine the in-text citations. How are they inserted?\n     How is the block quote handled differently in Chicago compared to MLA?\n     What is the relationship between the following entries on the Notes page: 3 and 11? 9 and 10; 3 and 4?\n   The Open Handbook has detailed information on formatting of both the MLA and Chicago bibliography to guide you.\nDirections Your assignment is to “translate” this student essay from the MLA style into the Chicago style. Convert the document\u0026rsquo;s formatting, page numbering, in-text citations, bibliographical entries, etc.2\nTo begin, download the essay to your own computer. Before you make any alterations, it might be wise to write out a detailed list of things that must be translated. The list of questions above may be of great assistance to you. You may need to consult the Open Handbook to come up with your plan of action.\n  You will find it difficult to force Microsoft Word into submission and make it do your bidding for the page numbering and the endnotes. While I don\u0026rsquo;t personally use Word, Microsoft provides some advice about page numbering on their support site. I have some further advice about the Notes page that I will relay to you in a class demo.\n  As you construct your Notes page you must determine what type of source is being cited in the MLA paper. Is this a book by one author? A scholarly journal? A work in an anthology? Something else? Once you identify the type of source being referenced in the MLA paper, you can use the Open Handbook chapter on the Chicago Style to figure out how to present this type of source in the Chicago style\u0026rsquo;s note form.
