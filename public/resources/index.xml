      <description>What is Hive? Hive is an open-source repository containing notes, ideas, and questions about our course readings and class discussions. We will build this resource together as a class&amp;mdash;sharing the work of interpreting, analyzing, and questioning the complex course readings we encounter. The &amp;ldquo;hive mind&amp;rdquo; is capable of discovering far more than any one individual. With luck, Hive will become a central resource in our class discussions and an indispensable aid to you as you craft your essays.</description>

      <description>Course FAQs 1. May I email you my essay for extra comments?   No.  I always give each essay draft a full set of written comments. And I&amp;rsquo;m committed to meet with any student who would like to go over them as many times as necessary. However, I usually do not take requests for extra comments via email unless there is no other possible way a student can meet with me in an office hour or at some other scheduled time.</description>
