<hr>
  <small>
<p>I can remember picking up my father&rsquo;s books before I could read. The
words themselves were mostly foreign, but I still remember the exact
moment when I first understood, with a sudden clarity, the purpose of
a paragraph. I didn&rsquo;t have the vocabulary to say &quot;paragraph,&quot; but I
realized that a paragraph was a fence that held words. The words
inside a paragraph worked together for a common purpose. They had some
specific reason for being inside the same fence.</p>
<p>&mdash;Sherman Alexie, &ldquo;<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/19/books/bk-42979">Superman and Me</a>&quot;.</p>
 </small>
<hr>
<p>A paragraph is a unit of text devoted to developing an idea. The idea is
usually stated in a <code>topic sentence</code>. The topic sentence most commonly
appears as the paragraph&rsquo;s first sentence; however, in what is known as
a <code>periodic paragraph</code>, the topic sentence will appear at the end.</p>
<p>Paragraphs should be <em>unified</em>. Every sentence in the paragraph should
focus in some way on the main idea expressed in the topic sentence. Further, the
paragraph&rsquo;s individual sentences should be presented in a logical order
and flow naturally from one to the other. While this is not a strict rule, it may be helpful to think of
paragraphs as miniature essays, each with their own thesis,
development, and proof.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-make-my-paragraphs-unified">How can I make my paragraphs unified?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Identify the main idea of the paragraph then remove or revise any
sentence that does not develop that main idea or repeats ideas
offered in another sentence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consider the order of your sentences. Is there a reason why they are
in the order they are, or do they need to be rearranged to make
sense to a reader?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Think about employing some <code>transitions</code> at the beginning of some
of the sentences. These will help you pinpoint the relationships
between your ideas/sentences and thus clarify these relationships
for your reader. To help guide your readers in understanding the
relationships between the sentences of your paragraphs, you might
use words like <em>For example</em>, <em>However</em>, <em>Additionally</em>,
<em>Specifically</em>, <em>On the other hand</em>, <em>Obviously</em>, <em>As a result</em>, <em>In
distinction to</em>, <em>In other words</em>, <em>Significantly</em>, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat key words to remind your audience of the paragraph&rsquo;s focus.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="strong-topic-sentences">Strong topic sentences</h2>
<p>Topic sentences function like a miniature thesis that communicates the
purpose or main idea of a paragraph. It is important that your topic
sentences are clear and accurately reflect the nature of the paragraph
it initiates.</p>
<p>Most commonly, topic sentences are strong, declarative statements that
make a claim. The sentences that follow the topic sentence in the
paragraph are used to support that claim. However, a topic sentence may
also be a question. In this case, the sentences that follow the topic
sentence are used to move toward a conclusion or further development or
deepening of the question.</p>
<h2 id="example-paragraphs">Example paragraphs</h2>
<p>This paragraph is part of a larger student essay performing a
theoretical analysis of Wes Anderson&rsquo;s 1998 film
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rushmore_%28film%29"><em>Rushmore</em></a>. The
essay uses theoretical ideas borrowed from Brazilian educational
theorist Paulo Freire. According the the author, the film&rsquo;s central
character, Max Fischer, fails to live up to the standards for education
that Freire articulates.</p>
<details open>
  <summary>An incoherent paragraph</summary>
  <div class="markdown-inner">
    <h1 id="heading"></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Liberation education culminates in an effort to change the world.
However, according to Freire, this change must embrace a communitarian
philosophy. This is what Max Fischer fails to understand. Max is keen to
change the world, shaping it to his needs and wants, but he fails to
understand Freire&rsquo;s imperatives on community, dialogue and consensus.
The views, ideas, and values held by a community are used to change the
world, not one individual&rsquo;s desire. Rather than shape the world <em>with</em>
others, Max insists on altering the world for himself alone.</p>
</blockquote>
  </div>
</details>

<ul>
<li>The <code>topic sentence</code> of the paragraph does not represent the
true nature of the paragraph. The paragraph is about Max&rsquo;s failure
to embrace a core idea expressed by Freire; however, the topic
sentence suggests the paragraph will only discuss something called
&ldquo;liberation education.&rdquo; Further, the paragraph&rsquo;s sentences are not
presented in a helpful or logical order.</li>
</ul>
<details open>
  <summary>Revised paragraph</summary>
  <div class="markdown-inner">
    <h1 id="heading"></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Although Freire argues that liberation education culminates in an effort
to change the world, Max Fischer&rsquo;s efforts in this regard fail to
embrace the philosophy of community that Freire demands. While Freire
beckons us to become &ldquo;transformers of the world&rdquo; (73), he insists
that it must only happen after a process of &ldquo;dialogue&rdquo;: an open exchange
of ideas between equal partners (78-9). For Freire, these moments of
co-inquiry are used to transform the world into a more democratic and
free society (86). While Max is keen to change the world, he selfishly
shapes it to <em>his own needs and wants</em>, failing to understand Freire&rsquo;s
insistence on community, dialogue, and consensus. Rather than shape the
world <em>with</em> others, as Freire recommends, Max insists on altering the
world for himself alone.</p>
</blockquote>
  </div>
</details>

<ul>
<li>This revised paragraph uses the <code>topic sentence</code> to announce
that the passage will focus on how Max Fischer fails to live up to a
standard expressed by Freire. This new topic sentence reflects the
nature of the paragraph much more faithfully. Furthermore, the
author arranges the sentences so as to educate the audience about
the Freire&rsquo;s theory before using it to criticize the actions of the
film&rsquo;s main character, Max Fischer. The result is a more logical and
intelligible paragraph.</li>
