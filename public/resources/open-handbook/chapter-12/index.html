<hr>
<p><small>You are right to be wary. There is much bullshit. Be wary of me too, because I may be wrong. Make up your own mind after you evaluate all the evidence and logic.</p>
<p>&mdash;Mark Rippetoe</p>
   </small>
<hr>
<p>Research writing involves a number of important skills: <code>library research,</code> <code>critical thinking,</code> the <code>evaluation of sources,</code> and the ability
to <code>synthesize</code> information through <code>summary,</code> <code>paraphrase,</code> and <code>quotation.</code>
Although synthesizing the thinking of others is an important part of the
research essay, in its true form the research essay strives for much
more than a mere restatement of what others have said on a particular
topic or question. As <a href="https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/common_writing_assignments/research_papers/genre_and_the_research_paper.html">Jack Baker and Allen
Brizee</a> state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A research paper is not simply an informed summary of a topic by means
of primary and secondary sources. It is neither a book report nor an
opinion piece nor an expository essay consisting solely of one&rsquo;s
interpretation of a text nor an overview of a particular topic.
Instead, it is a genre that requires one to spend time investigating
and evaluating sources with the intent to offer interpretations of the
texts, and not unconscious regurgitations of those sources. The goal
of a research paper is not to inform the reader what others have to
say about a topic, but to draw on what others have to say about a
topic and engage the sources in order to thoughtfully offer a unique
perspective on the issue at hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In high school you were perhaps asked to write research papers on
predetermined topics. These essays were probably not what Baker and
Brizee have in mind. Your projects were likely just reports&mdash;retellings of what
other scholars or writers have said on a topic. A true research essay
involves blazing a new path of inquiry where you produce original ideas,
questions, and arguments. A research paper is a contribution to an
ongoing conversation, a moment when you engage in dialogue with other
important voices about a topic that you value.</p>
<h2 id="the-academic-conversation">The Academic Conversation</h2>
<p>It is helpful to imagine a research essay as taking part in an ongoing
conversation. Unlike the dialogue that we have with most people in our
lives, these scholarly conversations occur in print&mdash;within published,
<a href="#peer-review">peer-reviewed</a> books and journal articles. Some conversations are
vibrant, with hundreds or even thousands of participants. Other
conversations are small, involving but a few specialists. Many
conversations have been going on for hundreds or even thousands of
years, while other conversations have only just started. Virtually
everything you might write or think about is already part of one or more
of these conversations. So, even if you don&rsquo;t know it at the time, when
you write about anything you are entering a conversation that already
exists.</p>
<p>Like any good conversationalist, the author of a research paper wants to
contribute his or her thoughts and opinions for the consideration of
others in the conversation. But if you want to be taken seriously in the
conversation, you have to know what the debates are about, who is
involved in the dialogue, and what has been said previously. In short,
you must remain mindful that your ideas have a <em>context</em>. This is why
research is important: it is how you come to understand what has already
been said and by whom.</p>
<p>The moves you make in these conversations will take many forms. We
might, for example, take the idea of one scholar and build on it in some
way&mdash;perhaps by extending it to a new context. Or, we might offer a new
interpretation of the meaning of a particular film, historical event, or
scientific experiment, distinguishing our view from the ones that already exist. During this process of articulating our own views, we often find ourselves in conflict with the thinking of others.
As a result, we will often contribute to the conversation by expressing the reasons
why we disagree in part or in whole with one or more of the other
individuals in the conversation. On the other hand, we may also choose to bring
in some ideas or words from others that we find helpful in making our own case. But, critically,
our writing should never be a mere rehashing of someone else&rsquo;s work. In any case, we must remain mindful
that the conversation we hope to take part in existed before we entered it, and that whatever we
might say or argue has a context that must be considered. Thus, every academic paper you write will not only
argue an original point or idea, it will also show how that idea emerges
from an existing conversation.</p>
<h2 id="the-research-topic">The Research Topic</h2>
<!--- Faculty often forget how deeply challenging it is to do academic research. Most of us are old, and we've been researching in libraries for decades. We know our way around a library; we have memorized at least one citation style be rote; complex, high-order cognitive operations like synthesis come naturally to us. In short, we know a lot of stuff. But that knowledge can be a handicap for our teaching---we often assume too much on behalf of our students. For them, the knowledge and skills we practice are not only difficult, they are mysteries. So it is good for us to occasionally recall how deeply challenging this all is. I do remember the day that my 18-year-old self stood in a large research library, my face burning red with embarrassment because I hadn't a clue how to begin. 

Research is, like most things in life, something that you must do in order to learn. Mistakes and confusion are great teachers. But it is nice when there is someone you can ask for help when things get really tough. 

Most of the texts on the market designed to help students with research-based writing are rather dishonest. They present academic research and research writing as a linear "process," an orderly list of steps that one must go through to begin and successfully complete a research essay or project. This misleading narrative generally begins with the formulation of a question, proceeds to the gathering of background information and secondary sources, and finally to the drafting, revision, and completion of the project. It is true that all these things must happen to make a research paper; the problem is that the description of the process in books presents an idealized and simplistic description of how a research project comes to be, develops, and concludes. The truth of the matter is that academic research is rarely a linear "process"; rather, it is a messy, elliptical, disorganized, frequently frustrating but also surprising and exhilarating one. More like real life.

--->
<p>Discovering your own research topic can be an overwhelming experience.
With so many things to choose from, finding a narrow focus is often
difficult. However, before you can truly begin your library research you
need to find a way to narrow your field of inquiry to a small set of
research questions or problems.</p>
<p>At the outset your research questions will be rather general and mundane. But that is perfectly normal: we all have to start somewhere. Once you have a general topic of interest, however, you can move into a more rigorous research phase.</p>
<p>As you begin your research, try to keep an open mind and allow yourself
to be pulled in new directions. It is important to think of the research
process as something more than a mere attempt to find information on a
predetermined topic or an effort to find evidence that supports an idea
or belief that one already holds, an error commonly referred to as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a>.
Instead, research <em>should be process of discovery</em> where you encounter
ideas and contemplate questions that you would have otherwise never
imagined. Research, done properly, has the power to change us&mdash;altering
our views, values, and sense of things. But you must first allow
yourself to become vulnerable to new ideas. During any particular
research project you should be prepared to change your mind and your
focus many, many times. You will frequently encounter dead ends; but you
will also experience the thrill of serendipitous discovery that will
take you down a path you would have never considered.</p>
<ul>
<li>One important thing to note here is to not confuse a research <em>topic</em> with a research <em>question</em>. The
research topic is just a general field of inquiry, a subject that you want to begin exploring. This stage of early research is designed to provoke a specific question or problem that you want to explore in more depth.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="finding-a-research-topic">Finding A Research Topic</h2>
<h3 id="exploring-topics-with-subject-searches">Exploring Topics with Subject Searches</h3>
<p>If you are having difficulty finding a narrow topic of interest, one way
to get started is to examine an organized list of <em>every</em> subtopic that
is related to your subject of inquiry. Since the <a href="http://catalog.loc.gov">Library of
Congress</a> assigns a series of <strong>subject
headings</strong> to every published book, you can easily browse a meticulously
categorized list of books that relate to your broader research subject.
For example, if you want to write an essay on the nation of Iraq, you
can perform a subject search with the search term &ldquo;Iraq.&rdquo; The result
will be an alphabetized list of <em>every</em> subject that scholars have
written on about Iraq&mdash;from agriculture to zoology. So, if you haven&rsquo;t yet
found a narrow focus for your project, you can use the subject headings
to &ldquo;shop&rdquo; for a subject that interests you.</p>
<h3 id="finding-additional-sources-through-subject-searches">Finding Additional Sources through Subject Searches</h3>
<p>Subject searches are also a helpful means of finding additional sources
on your topic once you have acquired one or more. For example, if you
discover that historian Alan Taylor&rsquo;s book <em><a href="http://libcat.dartmouth.edu/record=b4878766">The Civil War of
1812</a></em> is an important
source for your research project, you can use the book&rsquo;s subject
headings to find <em>all</em> of the other books written on those topics. As
you may see from this example, the Library of Congress
assigned the book the following three subject headings:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/img/copyright-page.png"/> 
</figure>

<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://search.library.dartmouth.edu/discovery/search?query=sub%2Cexact%2CUnited%20States%20--%20History%20--%20War%20of%201812%20--%20Social%20aspects%2CAND&amp;vid=01DCL_INST%3A01DCL&amp;mode=advanced">1. United States--History--War of 1812--Social aspects</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://search.library.dartmouth.edu/discovery/search?query=sub%2Cexact%2COntario%20--%20History%20--%20War%20of%201812%20--%20Social%20aspects%2CAND&amp;vid=01DCL_INST%3A01DCL&amp;mode=advanced">2. Ontario--History--War of 1812--Social aspects</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://search.library.dartmouth.edu/discovery/search?query=sub%2Cexact%2CNorthern%20boundary%20of%20the%20United%20States%20--%20History%20--%2019th%20century%2CAND&amp;vid=01DCL_INST%3A01DCL&amp;mode=advanced">3. Northern boundary of the United States--History--19th century</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In most library catalogs these subject headings are hyperlinked;
clicking on any of them leads you to a list of <em>every</em> other book in the
library that shares that particular subject heading. Thus, if your
research interest is the social aspects of the War of 1812, you can
quickly find every other book the library owns on that subject with a
subject search.</p>
<p>Though Dartmouth&rsquo;s library holdings are not nearly as large as the
Library of Congress, you can perform subject searches by selecting the
<a href="https://search.library.dartmouth.edu/discovery/search?vid=01DCL_INST:01DCL&amp;mode=advanced">advanced search</a>
feature of the <a href="https://search.library.dartmouth.edu/">library catalog</a>.</p>
<h2 id="finding-background-information">Finding Background Information</h2>
<p>A research project should always begin with the reading of general
background information about the topic. Before you can ask an
intelligent question about your topic or contribute to an ongoing
scholarly conversation, you need to develop a working knowledge of basic
facts to serve as a foundation for your project. The best way to develop
this basic understanding is to examine peer-reviewed reference works
such as encyclopedias, dictionaries, and other forms of <strong>reference
material</strong>.</p>
<p>Baker-Berry library has a number of helpful reference resources in this
regard. If you visit the <a href="http://researchguides.dartmouth.edu/reference">Library Reference
Resources</a> link in the
Library&rsquo;s <a href="http://researchguides.dartmouth.edu/">Research Guides</a>, you
will find an impressive array of organized reference materials like
bibliographies, encyclopedias, and dictionaries. Most of them are fully
digitized and do not even require a trip to the library. Always start
your research project with reference works and gain a basic grounding of
your topic before developing your research question or thesis. For
example, before you begin an essay on Iraqi feminism in the 1960s, you
should read the wikipedia article on the modern history of Iraq to get a
broad sense of the context you are entering with your writing. Other
helpful background information aids of note:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/">CIA World
Factbook</a>,
<a href="http://www.oxfordreference.com/">Oxford Reference Online</a>,
<a href="http://www.search.eb.com/">Britannica Online</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>A word of warning about Wikipedia (and internet sources in general): it
has not been through a process of <a href="#peer-revew">peer-review</a>. For that reason, it
is unwise to rely on Wikipedia as a source for a research project. Use
Wikipedia to gain background information on your topic and lead you to
other authoritative sources, but when it comes time to write your essay,
use a peer-reviewed source.</p>
<h2 id="research-guides">Research Guides</h2>
<p>Perhaps the single best aid for research at Dartmouth is the <a href="http://researchguides.dartmouth.edu">Research
Guide</a>. Various subject librarians
maintain research guides for every discipline. These guides contain
links to subject-specific reference materials (such as encyclopedias and
dictionaries), appropriate peer-reviewed journals, electronic databases,
biographies, e-texts, book reviews, and a variety of other helpful
resources and tips. These guides should be your first stop on a research
project and will be an indispensable resource for discovering sources on
your chosen topic. These guides are rather uneven. Some are quite
excellent; others are rather skimpy.</p>
<h2 id="searching-for-books">Searching for Books</h2>
<p>When you want to search for books that Dartmouth library owns or can
access electronically, use the <a href="http://libcat.dartmouth.edu/">Library
Catalog</a>. Dartmouth also offers a more
robust search tool known as
<a href="https://search.library.dartmouth.edu/">Primo</a>. Primo provides you with
an experience similar to Google; search terms are applied not only to
physical holdings, like books and media, but to electronic databases and
journals as well.</p>
<p>Primo is used as the backend for the search field on the library&rsquo;s front
page. After you submit your search term in the field, you will be
presented with a list of books, articles, databases, audio &amp; video,
associated digital content, or research aids. These items are organized
by relevance, as determined by an algorithm. After entering your search
you will notice ways to further refine your search by clicking on
several options on the left pane of the window. You might, for example,
select for peer-reviewed content, limit your search to books/articles,
or ensure that you only see content accessible through our library.</p>
<details open>
  <summary>🔴️ WARNING about Primo</summary>
  <div class="markdown-inner">
    <h1 id="heading"></h1>
<p>A word of caution about <a href="https://search.library.dartmouth.edu/">Primo</a>: while it searches the library catalog it its entirety, it <em>does not search all of the
electronic databases to which Dartmouth has a subscription</em>. This means
that if you exclusively use Primo for your searches, you will miss out
on potentially vast amounts of possible sources that could be discovered
through searching the various databases individually.

<h2 id="searching-for-periodicalsarticles">Searching for Periodicals/Articles</h2>
<p>Periodicals are publications that are published at regular intervals,
such as scholarly journals, magazines, and newspapers. Examining
periodicals&mdash;especially academic journals&mdash;is an important aspect of
research. Since books often take a year or more to go through the
process of peer review, editing, typesetting, and printing before they
become available for purchase, they often do not contain the most
current information. Articles, on the other hand, appear in a far
shorter period of time and generally contain the most up-to-date
research. For that reason, you should perform a review of journal
articles on your research topic to ensure that you are aware of recent
discoveries, arguments, and debates within the academic community who
share your research focus.</p>
<p>However, a common problem for undergraduate researchers is not knowing
which databases or journals are appropriate to search for information on a particular
topic. Unless you are a professional scholar, it is difficult to know
what the leading journals are in a particular field of study. This is
also a problem for faculty performing research outside of their area of
expertise. For example, an English professor would know that the
academic journal <em>PMLA</em> or the database JSTOR are excellent places to
look for articles on Herman Melville&rsquo;s novel <em>Moby Dick</em>, but the novice
researcher wouldn&rsquo;t know where to begin. You might also think that a database
called &ldquo;Web of Science&rdquo; would be a terrible place to look for articles on a
work of literature. You&rsquo;d be wrong.</p>
<p>To resolve this problem, our library has organized periodical databases
by discipline in the <a href="https://researchguides.dartmouth.edu/az.php">Database
Finder</a>. This is designed
to help you locate the specific journals, periodical databases, and reference materials that
are appropriate for each discipline or research subject. These are an
indispensable resource for discovering peer-reviewed sources on your
chosen topic.</p>
<p>You may also browse alphabetically if you know the name of the database
you are looking for.</p>
<h2 id="searching-with-precision">Searching with Precision</h2>
<p>While most students have some familiarity with searching through the Google search engine, library catalogs and databases don&rsquo;t always work in the same way. To query databases effectively and efficiently, you need to be familiar with <code>Boolean</code> searches.</p>
<p>Perhaps the common research problem is searches that produce too many results. Rather than page through hundreds or thousands of search results, you can use Boolean search strings to make your searches more precise. Boolean searches use what are known as <code>logical operators</code> to form search strings.</p>
<p>The three most common logical operators are <strong>AND</strong>, <strong>OR</strong>, and <strong>NOT</strong>. However, you should also learn how to use <code>exact phrases</code>, <code>truncation</code>, and <code>wildcards</code> in search strings.</p>

<h3 id="boolean-search-examples">Boolean search examples</h3>
<p>These Boolean terms are described in more detail below:</p>
<details >
  <summary>AND</summary>
  <div class="markdown-inner">
    <h1 id="heading"></h1>
<p>Although it may seem counterintuitive, <code>AND</code> is used to <em>narrow</em> the
number of sources you retrieve from a database. You can visualize the
search of a large academic database or library catalog using the
following diagram:</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><figure>
    <img src="/img/and.png"/> 
</figure>
<p>{ linguistics <code>AND</code> cognitive <code>AND</code> childhood }</div></p>
<p>In the search depicted above, a student has requested articles that
contain the subjects <strong>cognitive</strong>, <strong>linguistics</strong>, and <strong>childhood</strong>.
This particular search will only retrieve articles that contain <em>all
three terms</em>. This small subset of the larger subject sets is referenced
by the arrow. All the information represented by the other portions of
the three circles will be excluded. Thus, even if an article contains
two of the three search terms, it will be excluded from the results.</p>
<blockquote class="book-hint info">
  This search could have been improved with <code>truncation</code>, described below.
</blockquote>

  </div>
</details>

<details >
  <summary>OR</summary>
  <div class="markdown-inner">
    <h1 id="heading"></h1>
<p>Unlike the <code>AND</code> operator, <code>OR</code> seeks to <em>broaden</em> a search, as in
this example:</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><figure>
    <img src="/img/or.png"/> 
</figure>
<p>{ Virginia <code>OR</code> Ohio }</div></p>
<p>In the search depicted above, a student has searched for the subjects
Virginia <code>OR</code> Ohio. This search will return <em>every</em> article having the
subject of Virginia as well as <em>every</em> article with the subject of Ohio.
Unlike the <code>AND</code> search, where only articles containing <em>both</em> terms
are returned in the search results, the <code>OR</code> search yields every
source on both subjects regardless of whether those subjects appear
together in the same source. As a consequence, the <code>OR</code> search will
produce far more results.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since the <code>OR</code> operator lacks precision, it is most often used in
parenthetical searches, described below.</li>
</ul>

  </div>
</details>

<details >
  <summary>NOT</summary>
  <div class="markdown-inner">
    <h1 id="heading"></h1>
<p>The Boolean operator <code>NOT</code> is used to <em>subtract</em> or <em>screen out</em>
topics or keywords that are unwanted within the search results.</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><figure>
    <img src="/img/not.png"/> 
</figure>
<p>{ &ldquo;alternative energy&rdquo; <code>NOT</code> solar }</div></p>
<p>In the search depicted above, a student is researching alternative
energy and wants to exclude any information dealing with solar energy.
To remove all references to solar energy, the student has searched for
&ldquo;<strong>alternative energy</strong>,&rdquo; but has removed any articles from the search
results that contain the subject <strong>solar</strong> using the operator <code>NOT</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>NOT</code> operator is helpful when you find your search results are
polluted with unwanted items. This is often a problem when two
distinct things share the same name. For example, if you were
researching the Norse explorers known as the Vikings, you might discover
that your search results include unwanted information about the
Minnesota Vikings football team. You can subtract these unwanted results
by searching for <strong>Vikings <code>NOT</code> Minnesota</strong> or <strong>Vikings <code>NOT</code> football</strong>,
for example.</p>
<blockquote class="book-hint info">
  This search uses quotation marks to form an <code>exact phrase</code> search, described below.
</blockquote>

  </div>
</details>

<h3 id="advanced-searching">Advanced searching</h3>
<p>These Boolean operators can be used to create long, increasingly precise search strings when they are fortified with more advanced operators: <code>parentheticals</code>, <code>exact phrases</code>, and <code>wildcards</code>.</p>
<details >
  <summary>Parenthetical searches</summary>
  <div class="markdown-inner">
    <p>You can also use the various Boolean search terms in tandem using
parenthetical constructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(Ohio OR Virginia) AND unemployment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(cognitive AND linguistics) NOT childhood</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Such parenthetical searches follow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations">order of operations</a>, like in math
equations. In the first example, the search will first combine all the
articles with the keyword of <strong>Ohio</strong> to all the articles with the keyword <strong>Virginia</strong>, creating a large collection of search results. Afterward, the keyword <strong>unemployment</strong> will be applied to that collection using the <code>AND</code> operator, yielding the final search results that look for sources dealing with unemployment in either Virginia and Ohio. Similarly, the second example creates a large collection of results that share the subjects <strong>cognitive</strong> and <strong>linguistics</strong>, then all the items having the term <strong>childhood</strong> are removed from the results.</p>

  </div>
</details>

<details >
  <summary>Exact phrase searches</summary>
  <div class="markdown-inner">
    <h1 id="heading"></h1>
<p>Most Internet search engines and library catalogs default to the <code>AND</code>
operator when multiple terms are entered, even if it has not been typed
by the user. For example, if you search for <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>,
the search algorithm will actually use the search string <strong>artificial
<code>AND</code> intelligence</strong> to produce your results. In some circumstances this
may produce undesirable results. For example, we might
imagine an article about the &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; of using certain
&ldquo;artificial&rdquo; sweeteners in food for children. This is not an article that is relevant for your project.</p>
<p>To avoid this problem, you can instruct your search engine to perform
what is known as an <code>exact phrase search</code>. This is performed by
placing quotation marks around the exact words you are searching for:</p>
<ul>
<li>&ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; AND apocalypse</li>
</ul>
<p>By searching for &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; your search results will only
contain items that have that exact phrase within the document or title.</p>

  </div>
</details>

<details >
  <summary>Truncation and wildcards</summary>
  <div class="markdown-inner">
    <h1 id="heading"></h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>manufact* (truncation)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>wom?n (wild card)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you search for the terms steel <code>AND</code> manufacturing, your search
results may not include results with the terms <strong>manufacturer</strong>,
<strong>manufacture</strong>, <strong>manufactured</strong>, or <strong>manufactures</strong>. As a result, you
may not discover articles or books that are important to your research.
By truncating the word with an asterisk, however, you will gather all the
relevant search results.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you only search for wom<strong>an</strong>, you will potentially miss out on
the all the texts that mention wom<strong>en</strong> or wom<strong>y</strong>n. Or imagine that you are doing research on a certain type of organization. It would be wise to search for <strong>organi?ation</strong>, since much of the English-speaking world spells the word with an &ldquo;s&rdquo; instead of a &ldquo;z&rdquo; as we do here in the US. Without this, your research may become skewed to favor the literature on US-based institutions. However, using the wild card <code>?</code> you will search all spellings simultaneously, gathering all the
relevant results. <em>The question mark wild card should be used to replace a single letter only</em>.</p>
<p>To illustrate, look at these two searches on the JSTOR database:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www-jstor-org.dartmouth.idm.oclc.org/action/doAdvancedSearch?q0=Iraq+and+manufacturing&amp;f0=all&amp;c1=AND&amp;q1=&amp;f1=all&amp;c2=AND&amp;q2=&amp;f2=all&amp;c3=AND&amp;q3=&amp;f3=all&amp;c4=AND&amp;q4=&amp;f4=all&amp;c5=AND&amp;q5=&amp;f5=all&amp;c6=AND&amp;q6=&amp;f6=all&amp;acc=on&amp;la=&amp;sd=&amp;ed=&amp;pt=&amp;isbn=&amp;group=none">Iraq and manufacturing</a> (14,863 results)</p>

<h2 id="finding-a-book-in-the-library">Finding a Book in the Library</h2>
<p>Libraries use classification systems to organize their holdings. The most common in the English-speaking world are the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification">Dewey Decimal Classification</a> (DDC) and the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Classification">Library of Congress Classification</a> (LCC) systems. There are a number of other library systems. In Europe, for example, you will encounter the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Decimal_Classification">Universal Decimal Classification</a> (UDC) system. Like most research libraries in the US, Dartmouth&rsquo;s libraries use the Library of Congress system.</p>
<h3 id="the-library-of-congress-system">The Library of Congress System</h3>
<p>The Library of Congress assigns every copyrighted book a unique <strong>call number</strong> consisting of a series of numbers and letters that help you locate them on the library&rsquo;s shelves and indicate the subject matter contained within it. A typical call number will resemble the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>F 24 .T39 1990</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s break down the call number into its constituent parts:</p>
<table>

  <div class="markdown-inner">
    <h1 id="heading"></h1>
<h1 id="f-24-t39-1990"><code>F</code> 24 .T39 1990</h1>
<p>Using the <strong>letter line</strong>, determine the floor of the library where the book is shelved. The library&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/bakerberry/circ/stacksguides/">floorplan maps</a> will help you locate the proper section. Using our example call number above, we can determine that the <strong>F</strong> section is in <code>Stack Level A</code>.</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><figure>
    <img src="/img/floor-map.png"/>

  <summary>Step 2: Whole Number Line</summary>
  <div class="markdown-inner">
    <h1 id="heading"></h1>
<h1 id="f-24-t39-1990">F <code>24</code> .T39 1990</h1>
<p>Once on the appropriate floor, use the <strong>whole number line</strong> to find the
row where the book is shelved in the stacks. Using the example call
number, we will look through the stacks for the number <code>24</code>. Each library floor has a <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/bakerberry/circ/stacksguides/">floormaps</a> to help guide you; they are available in .pdf form or are posted on the wall of each floor, near the entrance.</p>
<p>As you walk through the stacks, look on the ends of each row for signs describing the range of books held within the row such as the one below:</p>
<div style="text-align:center"><figure>
    <img src="/img/stacks.jpg"/> 
</figure>
<p>{ <em>Use these signs to determine if a book is in the row</em>. }</div></p>
<p>Since <code>F 24</code> is within this range, our example book is in that row. Once in the proper row of shelves, proceed numerically until you find the <code>24</code>s.</p>

  </div>
</details>

<details >
  <summary>Step 3: Cutter Line</summary>
  <div class="markdown-inner">
    <h1 id="heading"></h1>
<h1 id="f-24-t39-1990">F 24 <code>.T39</code> 1990</h1>
<p>Finally, using the <code>Cutter line,</code> proceed alphabetically until you hit the Ts. Then proceed numerically until you find <code>.T39</code>, the address of our book.</p>
<ul>
<li>The date or volume information at the end of a call number will only be useful to you if you are looking for a particular edition of a book.</li>
</ul>

  </div>
</details>

<p>As you can see, the call number should be read from left to right using alphabetical and numerical orders. Thus, a book with a Subject line <code>F</code> would be shelved <em>before</em> a book with a Subject line <code>FA.</code>
Similarly, a Cutter line that reads <code>.T39</code> is shelved <em>after</em> <code>.T21</code>.</p>
<p>Maps of the library&rsquo;s floorplans are affixed to the walls on each floor. Free paper maps of the library are available at the circulation desk of the library. You may also consult the <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/bakerberry/circ/stacksguides/">maps and floorplans</a> online with your computer or smartphone.</p>

<h2 id="getting-sources-our-library-doesnt-own">Getting sources our library doesn&rsquo;t own</h2>
<p>A common problem in academic research is discovering that a book or
article you require for a project is checked out, missing, or not owned
by the library. There are a number of free services available to you
when you encounter this problem.</p>
<h3 id="borrow-direct-consortium">Borrow Direct consortium</h3>
<p>A number of the best libraries in the world have formed a consortium
designed to share resources and expand research opportunities for the
entire academic community. As students of Dartmouth College, you may
obtain borrowing privileges at any of the other participating libraries
including Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, University of Chicago, University of Pennsylvania,
Princeton, Yale and the Center for Research Libraries. The combined
resources total a staggering 50 million volumes.</p>
<p>To see if a book is available at another library, use a service called
<a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/res-share/borrowdirect/">Borrow Direct</a>. With
this service you may search every library in the consortium
simultaneously to see if the book you require is available at another
institution. If the book is owned by another school and is not checked
out at the time, you may request that the item be sent to our library.
These requests usually arrive in 4 working days or less.</p>
<h3 id="dartdoc">DartDoc</h3>
<p>If there is a book or article you would like to read that is not
available through Borrow Direct, you may request it from Dartmouth&rsquo;s
interlibrary loan program, known as DartDoc. To request an item, visit
the <a href="https://dartmouth.illiad.oclc.org/illiad/berry/logon.html">DartDoc</a>
webpage, select the appropriate form (article, book, book chapter,
etc.), and send your request electronically to the office. Staff will
request your item from another library, who will ship the book to our
library through the mail. If you are requesting a book chapter or
article, the donor library will send you a .pdf free of charge to your
DartDoc account.</p>
<p>If you are ordering a book, DartDoc is the <em>slowest</em> of all the
available options for requesting research materials. Requests may take
up to two weeks to be fulfilled.</p>
<h2 id="research-guides-1">Research guides</h2>
<p>If you are performing research on a topic and do not know where to
begin, Dartmouth&rsquo;s librarians have created an impressive collection of
<a href="http://researchguides.dartmouth.edu">Research Guides</a> that can help you
find background information, periodical databases, and academic journals
appropriate for your topic or discipline.</p>
<h2 id="peer-review">Peer review</h2>
<p>Peer review is a form of quality control in academic publishing. Before books or articles are published, they experience a rigorous process of evaluation by at least three experts who have advanced training in the field of study in question. These &ldquo;referees,&rdquo; as they are known, review the work anonymously. This anonymity theoretically ensures a more honest appraisal of the work under consideration for publication. When it works as intended, this scholarly review helps eliminate factual errors and other problems before the works are published. Thus, peer-reviewed works are more trustworthy than other sources of information.</p>
<h3 id="determining-if-a-source-is-peer-reviewed">Determining if a source is peer reviewed</h3>
<p>For novice researchers, distinguishing peer-reviewed sources from other published information can be challenging. Perhaps the best advice is to use only sources that you located within the library system, rather than things you found with a search engine on the open internet. You are far more likely to encounter trustworthy sources this way. Of course, is is also frequently the case that excellent information may be found on the open web; in these cases, we must use our best judgment to determine if the source is trustworthy or not. If you are confused about a source, ask your professor or one of the research librarians for assistance in making a determination.</p>
<h3 id="quick-tests-for-peer-review">Quick tests for peer review</h3>
<p>Here are a few test criteria that you may use to make a judgment call about whether a source has been peer reviewed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scholarly, peer-reviewed books are often published by an academic press associated with a college or university of repute. These publishers will have names like: Yale University Press or Duke University Press.</li>
<li>Scholarly, peer-reviewed articles are almost always written by credentialed scholars (often the text will contain the university affiliation of the professor/author/scientist).</li>
<li>Scholarly articles and books always have a bibliography.</li>
<li>Scholarly articles always contain citations and commonly have footnotes or endnotes.</li>
<li>Generally speaking, if you can find the publication at the dentist’s office or on an airport magazine rack, then it isn’t scholarly or peer-reviewed.</li>
<li>If the article contains advertisements, it is likely not scholarly.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-to-find-peer-reviewed-sources">How to find peer-reviewed sources</h3>
<p>Many periodical databases <em>only</em> contain peer-reviewed academic articles. A good example is JSTOR. Any article you find there will have been peer reviewed. Many other databases, such as Academic Search Complete, have search limiters that can be selected to ensure that the search results only contain peer-reviewed sources. Our own library catalog search engine provides the ability to limit the search to peer-reviewed books and periodicals.</p>
<h2 id="the-oxford-english-dictionary">The Oxford English Dictionary</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://search.library.dartmouth.edu/view/action/uresolver.do?operation=resolveService&amp;package_service_id=4424727860005706&amp;institutionId=5706&amp;customerId=5705">OED</a> is, without question, the greatest and
most complete dictionary ever created. As an historical dictionary, the
OED systematically traces the etymology of words in the English
language. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology">Etymology</a> is &ldquo;the
study of the history of words, their origins, and how their form and
meaning have changed over time.&rdquo; Thus, with the OED you can see when a
word entered or exited the English language and how its meaning evolved
over time.</p>
<p>The OED is quite helpful when you are reading a novel, poem, or document
that was written in a time period distant from our own. Since words fall
out of use and the meanings of words change over time, it can often be
difficult to interpret the meaning of the texts we read from the past.
The OED exists to help us with this problem. You can think of it as a
dictionary with a built-in time machine.</p>
<h2 id="helpful-research-suggestions">Helpful research suggestions</h2>
<h3 id="not-all-sources-are-equal">Not all sources are equal</h3>
<p>How do you know if you can trust your source? Here are some suggestions
for critically examining your sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Examine the credentials of the author</strong>. What is the author&rsquo;s
educational background? Do they have an advanced degree in the
subject that they are writing about? Are they affiliated with any
major institutions&mdash;such as a university or government department?
Does the author have a respected publication record that is
frequently cited by other experts in the field?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Examine the date of publication</strong>. When was the book or article
you are reading published? Since new discoveries and ideas are
produced every day, it is important to consult the most recent
sources on your research subject. Generally, the most current source
should be preferred over older sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Determine if the source has been peer-reviewed</strong>. Peer review is a
form of quality control in academic publishing. It ensures that the
information that is published has been properly evaluated and vetted
by a number of other professionals in the field. A peer-reviewed
source should be preferred over any other kind of information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Be wary of Internet sources</strong>. If your source comes from the
Internet, you should take care to verify its trustworthiness. Most
sites on the Internet are not peer-reviewed sources of information.
Misleading, politically motivated, and even propagandistic content
often masquerades as objective information on blogs, websites, and
discussion boards.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="taking-notes">Taking notes</h3>
<p>Now that you have some research materials in front of you, either at the
library or at home, it&rsquo;s time to make them useful to you. Before placing
source materials in your essay, <a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-2"><strong>take good notes</strong></a> by using <a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8/"><strong>summary</strong></a>,
<a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8/"><strong>paraphrase</strong></a>, and judicious <a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8/"><strong>quotation</strong></a> to take ownership of the
source materials. Ensure that you cite appropriately and that your
summaries and paraphrases use your own original language. This

<h3 id="citation-chasing-or-raiding-the-bibliography">Citation Chasing; Or, Raiding the Bibliography</h3>
<p>Students find one or two sources on a topic and then
despair of finding any more. However, with just one excellent article or
book, you can easily generate additional research leads. When you find a
book or article that relates to your project, scour the bibliography to
see what books and articles the author used to produce his or her work.
Make lists of the most promising sources by writing down all the
bibliographic information in a research journal. Locate these sources in
the library and then repeat the process. By using this technique of
routinely following up on sources cited in bibliographies, you can
generate a surprisingly large number of books and articles on your topic
in a relatively short time.</p>

<p>Keeping a research journal is an important habit to develop. Every
student or professor has had the unsettling realization that they have
used a quotation in their writing but have no recollection of where the
quote came from. Many hours can be consumed retracing steps. Frequently,
source materials are never located again. To avoid this problem, keep a
research journal where you record the bibliographic information of each
source you read or browse. This way you can quickly locate the
information again.</p>
<p>Although a paper notebook works well as a research journal, there are
some very promising electronic alternatives. This bibliographic software
can maintain a record of your sources, help you take notes, and even
produce perfectly formatted bibliography pages for your essays.</p>
<p>I recommend that you use <a href="http://zotero.org">Zotero</a> if you are interested in an electronic reference manager. It is free, open-source, and integrates with our library well. There are other options that cost money. For Mac users, there is <a href="http://www.sonnysoftware.com/">Bookends</a>. PC users may consider <a href="http://www.biblioscape.com">Biblioscape</a>.</p>
