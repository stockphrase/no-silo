<p>The ugly fact is books are made out of books.</p>
<p>&ndash;Cormac McCarthy</p>
</small>
<hr>
<p>Academic writing always involves integrating the thinking of others into
your own writing. There are only three ways that the words and ideas of
others may appear in your writing: <a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-6"><strong>summary</strong></a>, <a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-6"><strong>paraphrase</strong></a>, and
<a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-6"><strong>quotation</strong></a>. Writing an academic paper requires a mastery of all
three skills. It is critical to always give credit to the other authors
whose ideas or words you borrow. Failing to do so may result in the
accusation of <a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-10"><strong>plagiarism</strong></a>. The way scholars avoid
plagiarism is by using <code>signal phrases</code> and <a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-11"><strong>citations</strong></a>.</p>
<h1 id="using-signal-phrases">Using signal phrases</h1>
<h2 id="what-are-they">What are they?</h2>
<p>Signal phrases are words that tell your readers that you are borrowing
text or ideas from a source. The borrowed material could be quoted,
summarized, or paraphrased. The signal phrase, as the name suggests,
tells your reader that you are about to begin borrowing; after you have
presented the borrowed material, the concluding <a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-11"><strong>citation</strong></a> tells
the reader that the borrowing has concluded. Using signal phrases and
citations to bookend your borrowings from other texts helps you avoid
<a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-10"><strong>plagiarism</strong></a>, organize your writing, and help your readers understand
how your views relate to the views of the other writers you present in your writing.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-them">Why use them?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>They make it clear when you are transitioning from your own ideas
and writing to the ideas and writing of others and back again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They make it clear when you have begun to <code>paraphrase</code> or
<code>summarize</code>. Unlike <code>quotations</code>, paraphrases and summaries are not
formatted with quotation marks; therefore, it is difficult for
readers to know when or where you have begun to paraphrase or
summarize unless you include signal phrases and citations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They make the tone of your paper more academic and authoritative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They compel you to articulate how your ideas relate to those you
have borrowed from others. This will direct your attention to the
precise ways in which authors agree or disagree with you or each
other, and allow you to make these intersections clear to your
reader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using these signal phrases will help you to avoid
<a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-10"><strong>plagiarism</strong></a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-you-construct-a-signal-phrase">How do you construct a signal phrase?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Use the author&rsquo;s name</strong>. The first time you mention an author,
include the author&rsquo;s full name, the title of his or her work, and
perhaps a brief statement indicating the author&rsquo;s credentials. Once
you have introduced an author in your paper, only use his or her
last name if you mention him or her again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Use a strong verb to characterize what the author has done</strong>. The list below has possible selections. Be sure to pick a verb that most precisely describes the author&rsquo;s intent or action. For example:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>asserts, argues, believes, claims, emphasizes, insists, observes, reports, suggests, acknowledges, admires, agrees, corroborates, endorses, extols, praises, verifies, illustrates, expands on, rejects, complicates, contends, contradicts, denies, disagrees, refutes, questions, warns, proposes, implores, exhorts, demands, calls for, recommends, urges, advocates, wonders, asks, rejects, encourages.</p>

<h2 id="example-of-a-signal-phrase-use">Example of a signal phrase use</h2>
<p>Here is an example of a student properly using signal phrases and
citations to indicate borrowings from other sources:</p>
<div class="container">

<p>Joe Student</p>
<p>English 120</p>
<p>Prof. Taylor</p>
<p>Oct. 28, 2012</p>
<div style="text-align:center"> Origins of Taoism: A Fake Essay </div>
<p>      A number of scholarly views exist that attempt to explain the nature and origins of Taoist religious practices. <span class="highlight">In his book <em>The Tao Practice</em>, scholar Rico Burgerton argues</span> that &ldquo;Taoism emerged during a period
of unprecedented struggle, deprivation, and suffering in the fourth
century BCE&rdquo; (89). <span class="highlight">This historical condition, he explains,</span> resulted in religious and cultural practices and
beliefs that valued asceticism and practiced detachment from desire
(12). However, other historians disagree. <span class="highlight">In his &ldquo;Up and Down of the Tao,&rdquo; Li Chang argues</span> that Taoism as we know it
was largely a creation of the 17th-century, a time of relative
prosperity, radical socio-political change, and modernization in China
(5). <span class="highlight">According to this view</span>, Taoist asceticism was actually a <em>rejection</em> of this tumultuous
cultural transformation&mdash;an expression of nostalgia for a simpler time
in the ancient Chinese past (22). But which is the correct answer? Did
Taoism emerge in a time of poverty or a time of plenty? <span class="highlight">In my view,</span>
both views are problematic . . .
<div class="edge-shadow"></div>
</div>
</div></p>
<h2 id="heading"></h2>
<p>Notice here how the author of this paragraph uses <code>signal phrases</code> and <code>citations</code> to distinguish his voice from the two source texts he is using. The student announces
that he is borrowing words or ideas (in the form of quotations, summary,
or paraphrase) with a signal phrase and the author&rsquo;s name, then bookends the
borrowing with a citation. The paragraph concludes with the student transitioning from the source texts to his own thoughts, posing a series of questions that he will try to answer in the reminder of the paper. <em>The moves on display here are the foundational building blocks of all academic writing</em>. This is one of the more important skills to master for success in academic writing contexts.</p>
<p>We can represent this important tactic with the following formula:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="highlight"><strong>Signal phrase + borrowed text/idea + citation</strong>.</span></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="quotation">Quotation</h1>
<h2 id="when-should-i-quote-something">When should I quote something?</h2>
<p>Quotation is the inclusion of another author&rsquo;s exact wording in your own
writing. While quotation is a critical element of all academic writing,
you must be judicious in its use. Only quote when the rhetorical
situation requires it. The overuse of quotation can make you appear lazy
or lacking in confidence. That said, there are moments when quotations
are entirely justified and useful. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you are interpreting literature such as a poem or novel, the
specific language used in the text is the subject of your essay.
That is to say, your argument is about the meaning of the <em>exact
words</em> chosen by the author for his or her literary work. It is
critical in these instances to use quotations from the literary text
and then explain what those words mean to your audience&mdash;a process
known as <code>&quot;close reading&quot;</code> in literary studies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you are making an argument it is often helpful to use the words
of known authorities to help make your case. While you may not be a
doctor, physicist, or professional journalist, you may use their
words and arguments to help give credibility to your ideas. While
using the exact words of these important authorities can be
rhetorically effective, make sure to use them prudently. If your
essay becomes a mere tissue of quotation, your authority as an
author is undermined. The strongest voice in your essay should be
your own. Allow these other voices to be briefly heard; don&rsquo;t allow
them to drown out your own voice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the source text contains language that is memorable, beautiful,
or particularly apt, quotation is justified. If you feel that
summarizing or paraphrasing would do violence to the original
language, using a quotation is often the best choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A quotation is often necessary when you describe legal discourse
(such as a law or court ruling) where words cannot be paraphrased or
summarized without altering the meaning and effect of the legal
language.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For most other circumstances, <code>summary</code> or <code>paraphrase</code> of the original language is best.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-integrate-quoted-material">How do I integrate quoted material?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use a <code>signal phrase</code> to introduce the quoted passage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use quotation marks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Provide a <code>citation</code> in your chosen format, such as MLA or
Chicago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If necessary, use <a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-9"><strong>ellipsis</strong></a> or <a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-9"><strong>brackets</strong></a> to alter the source, satisfy grammar, or provide clarifying information.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-should-i-avoid">What should I avoid?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid excessive use of quotation</strong>. If you quote too often it can
make it appear that you have not fully read or understood the source
material. It may also make your writing appear lazy and thoughtless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid excessive use of block quotation</strong>. Block quotations should
be rare; reserve them for special language that you believe cannot
be summarized or paraphrased. Try instead to use a mixture of
quotation, paraphrase, and selective quotation to integrate the
source material into your writing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid inserting a quote within your writing without providing your
commentary or explanation</strong>. Explain to your audience what your
quotes mean and connect them to your broader argument so that the
reader will understand how to interpret them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid inserting quotations without signal phrases</strong>. Quotations
should be introduced and woven into your own writing. They should
rarely stand alone.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example-of-a-quotation">Example of a quotation</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine that the following is the source text that you would like to quote in your own writing:</p>

<p>      At the heart of the environmentalist worldview is the conviction that
human physical and spiritual health depends on sustaining the planet in
a relatively unaltered state. Earth is our home in the full, genetic
sense, where humanity and its ancestors existed for all the millions of
years of their evolution. Natural ecosystems&mdash;forests, coral reefs, marine
blue waters&mdash;maintain the world exactly as we would wish it to be
maintained. Our body and our mind evolved precisely to live in this
particular planetary environment and no other. When we debase the global
environment and extinguish the variety of life, we are dismantling a
support system that is too complex to understand, let alone replace, in
the foreseeable future (238).</p>
<p>&ndash; E.O. Wilson, &ldquo;<a href="https://doi-org.dartmouth.idm.oclc.org/10.1016/0303-2647%2893%2990052-E">Is Humanity Suicidal?</a>&rdquo;
<div class="edge-shadow"></div>
</div>
</div></p>
<h2 id="sample-quotations-from-the-source-text">Sample quotations from the source text:</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In a recent essay, scientist E.O. Wilson considers a dark truth
about humanity: &ldquo;we are dismantling a support system that is too
complex to understand, let alone replace, in the foreseeable
future&rdquo; (238).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;At the heart of the environmentalist worldview,&rdquo; claims scientist
E.O. Wilson, &ldquo;is the conviction that human physical and spiritual
health depends on sustaining the planet in a relatively unaltered
state&rdquo; (238).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One important biologist insists that if we &ldquo;debase&rdquo; the planet we
risk &ldquo;dismantling a support system&rdquo; that is too complicated to
understand or replace (Wilson 238).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-if-the-original-quotation-has-an-error">What if the original quotation has an error?</h2>
<p>Occasionally you will want to quote a text that contains an error of
some sort. Perhaps the author used the wrong word or there is a
misspelling or grammatical error. In these cases, you may want to
indicate to your readers that the error exists in the original text and
is not a sloppy accident of your own making. To communicate this to your
readers, use the Latin term <em>sic</em>, or &ldquo;thus,&rdquo; next to the offending
word or error. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>According to the report, &ldquo;The children were told to make there
[sic] beds&rdquo; (98).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-do-i-quote-someone-elses-quotation">How do I quote someone else&rsquo;s quotation?</h2>
<p>Occasionally you will discover a quotation in someone’s writing that you would like to use in your own writing. These are known as <code>indirect quotations</code>. How do you cite that?</p>
<p>Let’s look at an example. Imagine that you discover the following paragraph on page 77 of a scholarly article written by John Mackey:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chimene Keitner discusses the question of the rule of law within the novel <em>Ramona</em>, arguing that this text “illustrates the tensions and misunderstandings that can arise when people from different communities find themselves in situations of jurisdictional overlap” (54). She maintains that the fact that the Señora views the Land Commission’s takings of her property as “theft” is indicative that at least two distinct understandings of the rule of law are operating (57).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="mla">MLA</h3>
<p>If you want to borrow the Chimene Keitner quotation, you would write the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scholar Chimene Keitner persuasively argues that the Señora’s plight demonstrates the “tensions and misunderstandings that can arise when people from different communities find themselves in situations of jurisdictional overlap” (qtd. in Mackey 77).</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Place John Mackey’s article in your bibliography, not Keitner’s.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chicago">Chicago</h3>
<p>Here is the corresponding Chicago form for indirect quotations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scholar Chimene Keitner persuasively argues that the Señora’s plight demonstrates the “tensions and misunderstandings that can arise when people from different communities find themselves in situations of jurisdictional overlap.” ³</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>In your notes page, give the author and publication information of the source quoted followed by the source where you found the quote. For example:</li>
</ul>

  <p class="p3">
    3. Chimene Keitner, “The Challenge of Building Inter-Communal Rule of Law in Helen Hunt Jackson’s <em>Ramona</em>,” <em>Law and Literature</em>, 15, no. 1 (2003): 54, quoted in John Mackey, <em>The California Novel</em> (Boston: Stone and Branch Books, 2012), 77.
  </p>
<h1 id="summary">Summary</h1>
<p>In a summary you present the ideas of another writer in a condensed
form. The length of a summary is dictated by your rhetorical needs, but
<em>they are always shorter than the original text</em>. For example, the
summary of a large book could be 20 pages, one paragraph, or one
sentence. Although a summary sacrifices specificity and detail in the
interest of brevity, it must always remain a faithful representation of
the original text.</p>
<h2 id="why-are-summaries-important">Why are summaries important?</h2>
<p>Summary is one of the central skills needed for academic writing.
Summary often appears in an academic essay&rsquo;s introductory section(s) to
provide readers with background information or historical context. It is
also used to explain complex scholarly conversations that the writer
plans to engage with his or her essay. An excellent summary of this
broader scholarly conversation goes far to establish you as a
knowledgeable authority with your readers&mdash;someone whose views should be
trusted and considered. Summary is particularly useful when we make use
of secondary sources in our writing. If we want to use or introduce
another source in our own writing, we use summary to inform our audience
about the arguments and ideas contained within it in an abbreviated
form. We also make significant use of summary in the complex work of
<a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-6"><strong>synthesis</strong></a>, where we explain how two or more texts relate to one
another.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-incorporate-summaries">How do I incorporate summaries?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Since summaries do not use quotation marks, you must take care to
indicate to your readers that you are borrowing from the work of
others. This is primarily accomplished through the use of a
<code>signal phrase</code> and a <a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-11"><strong>citation</strong></a>. Think of the signal phrase and the
citation as a way to bookend a borrowing from a source. The signal
phrase alerts readers that you are about to borrow from another
text; the citation is used to show that the borrowing has
concluded. An appropriate citation always notes the page(s)
summarized.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-should-i-avoid-1">What should I avoid?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid plagiarizing</strong>. Remember, summarized material is still
borrowed material, even though you have greatly condensed it and put
it entirely in your own words. Make sure that any summarized
material is introduced with a <code>signal phrase</code> and concluded with a
<a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-11"><strong>citation</strong></a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example-of-a-summary">Example of a summary</h2>

<p>     When academic territories were parceled out in the early twentieth
century, anthropology got the tellers of tales and history got the
keepers of written records. As anthropology and history diverged, human
differences that hinged on literacy assumed an undeserved significance.
Working with oral, preindustrial, prestate societies, anthropologists
acknowledged the power of culture and of a received worldview; they knew
that the folk conception of the world was not narrowly tied to proof and
evidence. But with the disciplinary boundary overdrawn, it was easy for
historians to assume that literacy, the modern state, and the commercial
world had produced a different sort of creature entirely&mdash;humans less
inclined to put myth over reality, more inclined to measure their
beliefs by the standard of accuracy and practicality. (35)</p>

<ul>
<li>As Patricia Nelson Limerick argues in <em>The Legacy of Conquest</em>,
historians have falsely assumed that literate societies with vibrant
economies and systems of governance were never beholden to myth or
superstition (35).</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="paraphrasing">Paraphrasing</h1>
<p>Think of paraphrase as a translation from English into English. It
involves taking language from a source, putting it into your own words,
and arranging it within your own original sentence structure(s). Unlike
<code>summary</code>, which aims to reduce or distill an idea, a paraphrase
should be similar in length to the original passage.</p>
<h2 id="why-are-paraphrases-important">Why are paraphrases important?</h2>
<p>Accurate paraphrase demonstrates mastery of your source materials and
indicates an author who is in control of his or her own writing and
thinking. Whereas excessive <code>quotation</code> may reveal an uncertain or
tentative author, paraphrase demonstrates control and confidence.
However, ensure that your paraphrases do justice to the original, or
risk compromising your authority with your readers.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-i-incorporate-paraphrases">How do I incorporate paraphrases?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Like summaries, paraphrases do not use quotation marks. As a result,
you must take care to indicate to your readers that you are
borrowing from the work of others with a <code>signal phrase</code> and
<a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-11"><strong>citation</strong></a>. As you move from your own writing to the paraphrase
of others, use a signal phrase to indicate this transition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>End the paraphrase with an appropriate citation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-should-i-avoid-2">What should I avoid?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid plagiarizing</strong>. Remember, paraphrased material is still
borrowed material, even though you have put it in your own words.
Make sure that any paraphrased material is introduced with a
<code>signal phrase</code> and concluded with a <a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-11"><strong>citation</strong></a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Avoid patchwriting.</strong> <a href="/resources/open-handbook/chapter-10"><strong>patchwriting</strong></a> is a process of merely
changing a word or a phrase here or there from the original text and
presenting the result as your own writing. Instead, ensure that you
use your own words and sentence structure in your paraphrase.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example-of-a-paraphrase">Example of a paraphrase</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine that the following is the source text that you would like to paraphrase in your own writing:</p>

<li>In <em>The Legacy of Conquest</em>, Patricia Nelson Limerick argues that
during the early part of the last century the disciplines of
anthropology and history went their separate ways. While anthropology
focused on unlettered and illiterate communities, history became the
study of societies who produced texts and records. Within the field of
anthropology, a firm belief developed that oral cultures were
characterized by mythological worldviews and superstitious beliefs; on
the other hand, historians improperly assumed that literate cultures
were filled with individuals who only used reason and evidence to
guide their thinking (35).</li>
