      <description>Alan C. Taylor    I grew up on a mountain swallowed up by kudzu just across the river from Chattanooga, Tennessee.
I teach writing and research courses for first-year students at Dartmouth College&amp;rsquo;s Institute for Writing and Rhetoric.
In college and graduate school I studied nineteenth-century American literature and history. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in backcountry settlements in the early republic and conflicts between Native peoples and settlers.</description>
