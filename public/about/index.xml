      <description>Alan C. Taylor    I grew up on a mountain swallowed up by kudzu just across the river from Chattanooga, Tennessee.
In college and graduate school I studied nineteenth-century American literature, culture, and history. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in backcountry settlements in the early republic and conflicts between Native peoples and settlers.
I teach writing and research to first-year students at Dartmouth College.
I&amp;rsquo;m a mildly accomplished computer nerd.</description>
