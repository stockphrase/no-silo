1). LIST ALL ARGUMENTS: Identify each argument made in the reading. You might choose a certain symbol to flag arguments during your reading and textual annotations. You might use the letter A, for example. One of the main skills required here is the ability to distinguish assertions and claims (arguments) from the things that support them: examples, metaphors, and evidence. In a separate document, write down a series of numbered statements that summarize each argument that you detect in the text. 2). SUMMARY: In a summary you present the ideas of another writer in a condensed form. The length of a summary is dictated by your rhetorical needs, but they are always shorter than the original text. Although a summary sacrifices specificity and detail in the interest of brevity, it must always remain a faithful representation of the original text. Write a tight summary of the entire argument; use LIST ALL ARGUMENTS as your guide. Don’t leave anything out. Don't add anything that isn't there. No opinions or evaluations. Just the facts.
3). QUICK RESPONSE: What part(s) of this essay gave you pause? Made you curious about something? Did it inspire some thinking about something? Make you curious about something? Pick something particular and explain what the esssay inspired for you personally. While the response genre will be personal in nature, it should not be without substance. For example, it isn't enough to say "I liked it" or "This was no good."
4). QUICK ARGUMENT: Find a particular argument within the essay and make an argument of your own about it. Is the writer wrong about something? Could this idea be applied to something else that the author doesn't mention? If we think the author is right, should we do something concrete or change something in our lives based on the argument? 5). CLOSE READING: A passage means what it says because the author arranged a series of words together in such a way as to produce that meaning. A ‘close reading’ is a detailed explanation of what a passage means using only the words in the passage as evidence. What does this passage mean? What is the evidence in the text that supports your view of what the passage means? 6). PARAPHRASE: Say the same thing the author says in about the same length using your own words and sentence structure. Think of this as a translation from English into English. 7). COMPARISON: Sketch out the ways two texts seem to be in conversation with each other on some issue, problem, or argument. Are they talking about the same issue but using different vocabulary or rhetorical strategies? Do they seem to differ on key areas of this shared concern? 8). CRITICAL THINKING: Let’s think carefully about the argument of this text. Is it convincing? Are there weaknesses in the reasoning or evidence? Are there things that are omitted? Blind spots of some sort? 9). KEY PASSAGES: What are the key moments in the text? These will no doubt include moments where key arguments are made; however, it may also just include certain terms, turns of phrase, or memorable language that seems to invite quotation in our own writing. Imagine that you are stripping the argument for parts so that you can use them for something you are building. What are the essential, necessary items that you need to extract?
10). RHETORICAL ANALYSIS: Examine how the author chose to present their ideas, knowing that she could have chosen differently. For example, one author might write a traditional argument while another may choose to tell a story. A write might be furious, mocking, sarcastic; or, they may take the "high road" and try to win the audience with a high-minded and respectful form of discourse. Were these choices effective for for you personally as a reader? What about for a broader audience?
11). THE BIG IDEA: Write down a ‘big idea’ that you had today in class. This could be something someone said, an idea from a reading, or something you thought. Perhaps this idea might relate to some of your own writing in the class. Or relate to something more personal for you. This thought might be useful later, so memorialize it.

Please write down your responses and keep them in a safe place&mdash;they will be used in a conference during the first week of classes this winter term.
My rationale for this assignment is explained somewhat in question #6 in the FAQ.
Step 1: Review your writing After submitting all of your work for the term, gather together all of the drafts from the three major writing assignments. (You are saving all your work, right?) Carefully examine the drafts for each of the main essay assignments in order, from first draft to final draft. Take time to compare the pieces and notice how they evolved due to your own process of revision and in response to the commentary you received from your professor, teaching assistant, and fellow students.
For each of the three essays, write down a response to the following questions: How did your essay change from first draft to final form? What was particularly strong about this revised, final version? What things could you still improve upon in this final draft? What were you particularly proud of in the final draft? Considering the whole process of writing this essay, what did you learn? Step 2: Review your learning Write a short response to the following questions: Thinking about your experience of the class as a whole, what have you learned? Was there something you expected to learn, but didn&rsquo;t? Are there specific things you would like to work on in the winter term? What do you struggle with as a writer and student? Step 3: Review your participation Write a short response to the following questions: How many classes or TA sessions did you miss? How engaged were you in the class? Did you complete all the assignments? Were all the assignments turned in on time? Did you give your best effort on each assignment? Expressed as a percentage, how much of the reading did you do? How much did you contribute to Hive? Was this your best effort at sharing/helping others? How often did you contribute on discussion days? Could you have contributed more to the conversation? Step 4: Final grade Taking into account all of these reflections and self-evaluations, what final grade would you suggest for yourself?

No more than 3 pages Use the MLA format Special requirements Perform no research for this essay. Do not seek help: no googling; no library visits; don’t ask your uncle, friends, or roommate; no ChatGPT. Just use your head and write what you think in the best way you know how. Don&rsquo;t worry: you are going to do great! I really just want to know what you think. Essay 1 Revision Formal education is one of the central features of our lives&mdash;a deep, organizing structure that has shaped and influenced us in profound and unaccountable ways. Education, like culture more broadly, is so ordinary and pervasive that it has become thoroughly naturalized, its powerful influence rendered virtually invisible to us. Education, in short, is just something that we&rsquo;ve always done, something that has always been with us, something that is self-evidently the right and obvious thing to do&mdash;part of the everyday backdrop of life that we take for granted and rarely consider critically.
Although it is quite difficult to escape the naturalizing trance that comes from our habitual exposure to such common features of our lifeworld, it is important to develop a capacity for this form of analysis&mdash;to see more clearly the weird within the familiar. Let&rsquo;s attempt to do something like this now: take a step outside of your own experience of formal education and try to gain some distance on the practices and normalizing structures that have been such a large part of your life since before you can even remember. Try to set aside all you know. Defamiliarize these experiences: hold them at a distance and try to look at them with a fresh perspective, as if for the first time. What do you see? This will require some effort: it is quite difficult to step outside of the automaticity that we fall into when we confront something that we think know well. Our knowledge and familiarity and comfort with a thing often blinds us to new insights about it; in an odd sense, our knowledge can be a handicap.
Alien Ethnography
It might be helpful to begin your thinking by adopting the objective, cold analysis of some alien sociologist from outer space who has traveled many light-years to study the ways of humans.
After cultivating this perspective, ask yourself: Are the purposes of education we commonly cite (perhaps even the ones you argued for in your first draft) actually reflected in how we construct systems of education? If not, what values does education truly seem to promote when we look at it in this new light? Does education as we have known it have some occulted or clandestine goals or purposes? Are there things that seem odd or counterproductive or wrong in how we go about education? Why do we do the things we do? Why have we built the educational institutions that we have? Are these &ldquo;educational&rdquo; experiences and structures actually promoting what we claim they do?
Write a response to your first draft at the conclusion of your current one exploring these (or related) questions.
To help you in this work, gather the syllabi from your other two courses and closely examine these textual artifacts, like an archaeologist unearthing a shard of pottery in the desert. What do you make of these things? Since you are entering the new (and strange) culture of higher education, these textual artifacts may help you understand the values, ideas, preconceptions, and preoccupations that have authority there.
Your final draft should be about 1,500 words in length.
First Draft Notes Topic Sentences and Unified Paragraphs Topic Sentences Topic sentences function like a miniature thesis that communicates the purpose or main idea of a paragraph. It is important that your topic sentences are clear and accurately reflect the nature of the paragraph it initiates.
Most commonly, topic sentences are strong, declarative statements that make a claim. The sentences that follow the topic sentence in the paragraph are used to support that claim. However, a topic sentence may also be a question. In this case, the sentences that follow the topic sentence are used to move toward a conclusion or further develop the question.
Some generally good advice about topic sentences: Use the topic sentence of each paragraph to clearly state the subject or focus of the paragraph. If the paragraph and topic sentence are not in sync, or if the topic sentence doesn&rsquo;t actually state the nature of the paragraph, you need to revise it.
Use the topic sentence to set forth a claim that supports the thesis and drives the argument forward. This is not a hard rule, and there are other ways to start a paragraph, but it is a strong way that helps keep you focused.
Compare:
My high school has a unique program that allowed students to experiment and explore.
Education facilitates inquiry and exploration, which are critical needs in the life of every human being.
More information on topic sentences, including examples, here in the Open Handbook.
Paragraphs Some generally good advice about paragraphs: Paragraphs should be unified: every sentence in the paragraph should focus in some way on the main idea expressed in the topic sentence. Further, the paragraph’s individual sentences should be presented in a logical order and flow naturally from one to the other. While this is not a strict rule, it may be helpful to think of paragraphs as miniature essays, each with their own thesis, development, and proof.
More information on paragraphs, including examples, here in the Open Handbook. Everyday vs. Every day In the first draft I saw many students who were confused about everyday (as one word) and every day (as two words). They are very different in their meanings:
everyday: adj. As one word you use it to mean that something is ordinary or common. In fact, just substitute one of those words in place of everyday to see if the sentence still makes sense.
every day adv. As two words it is an adverbial phrase that means &ldquo;each day&rdquo; or &ldquo;daily,&rdquo; a reference to the frequency of a certain action.
My son eats oatmeal everyday.
My son eats oatmeal every day.
The everyday struggles of many Americans are truly heartbreaking.
The every day struggles of many Americans are truly heartbreaking.
The F-bomb solution™ For no particular reason I have discovered that if you can put an f-bomb between every and day then it should be two words:
I go to the store every [f*ing] day.
These are my every [f*ing] day pants.
A clever way to remember this:
Every day (See the space? An F-bomb fits in there. Two words.)
Everyday (No space for the bomb. One word.)
Comma Splices and Semicolons Semicolons A. Used to separate a series of items containing commas. (Not very common).
I went to London, England, Paris, France, Bristol, Tennessee, and Berlin, Germany.
I went to London, England; Paris, France; Bristol, Tennessee; and Berlin, Germany.
B. Used to link two independent clauses to suggest a connection. (Very common).
My son had trouble sleeping last night; I shouldn&rsquo;t have given him that chocolate cupcake.
Americans say they appreciate the hard work of teachers; however, very few are willing to pay them a decent wage.
C. Things you don&rsquo;t do with semicolons.
Please get three things from the store; bread, milk, and a lot of beer.
Please get three things from the store: bread, milk, and a lot of beer.
Comma splice errors A comma splice error occurs when you use a comma to connect two independent clauses:
I love my red truck, it is a Chevy Colorado.
I love my red truck. It is a Chevy Colorado.
I love my red truck; it is a Chevy Colorado.
The Em Dash — The em dash is perhaps the most versatile punctuation mark: it can function like a comma, colon, or parentheses. In formal writing it is used to indicate extra information or an aside&mdash;much as you would do with commas, colons, or parentheses. There is a good explainer on this punctuation mark on the Merriam-Webster site. The two most common uses in formal writing are displayed here:
The Soviets gave us the greatest exercise tool ever invented - the kettlebell.
The Soviets gave us the greatest exercise tool ever invented—the kettlebell.
The Soviet-Afghan War&mdash;a main contributor to the fall of the Soviet Union&mdash;has received increased scrutiny by scholars as America&rsquo;s mission there has foundered.
Emphasis How do you show emphasis in formal writing?
Unless I am being unusually calculating, I don&rsquo;t DECIDE to befriend someone . . .
Unless I am being unusually calculating, I don&rsquo;t decide to befriend someone . . .
Unless I am being unusually calculating, I don&rsquo;t decide to befriend someone . . .
The 5 Paragraph Essay Everyone was taught the 5-paragraph essay form in high school. There is an introduction with a thesis, three paragraphs of support, and a summary conclusion that restates the thesis.
The problem is that you can&rsquo;t really do much in 5-paragraphs and your time at Dartmouth will require you to reach for rhetorical forms that can accommodate much more complexity. One place to begin is to imagine that your paper is as many paragraphs as needed in order to justify the thesis. There is no magic number of paragraphs. There is no recipe or formula.
Another thing to reconsider is the summary conclusion that is a hallmark of the 5-paragraph essay. I saw many of these. You say what you&rsquo;ve just said again at the end. Strong readers might find this somewhat insulting since it assumes we can&rsquo;t understand what we just read or hold these ideas in our heads for 5 paragraphs.
If we imagine that the reader has a good grasp on what you&rsquo;ve just argued, how should your piece end? What do you need to say or do or explain to achieve closure? What do you hope the reader takes away from your argument? What should they do in response to it?

`}),e.add({id:8,href:"/courses/writing-2/essay-3/",title:"Essay Three",content:` Essay Three: Theoretical Analysis Prompt Max Fischer has an insatiable appetite for extracurricular activities: fencing, bee-keeping, yankee racers, calligraphy, backgammon, theater, and on and on and on. These projects and clubs are forms of self-improvement&mdash;kinds of sovereign inquiry&mdash;but they completely dwarf his responsibilities in the traditional disciplines of formal education: geometry, history, English, etc. According to Dr. Guggenheim, Max is &ldquo;one of the worst students&rdquo; at Rushmore Academy.
But what might Paulo Freire argue about Max&rsquo;s behavior as a human being and a scholar? How might we use Freire&rsquo;s ideas from &ldquo;The &lsquo;Banking&rsquo; Concept of Education&rdquo; to analyze or judge the educational trajectory and behavior of Max?
Taking what you know of Freire&rsquo;s thinking in &ldquo;The &lsquo;Banking&rsquo; Concept of Education,&rdquo; write a theoretical analysis of Wes Anderson&rsquo;s Rushmore.
Use Freire&rsquo;s essay as as theoretical lens. You will have to work hard to provide your audience proper context&mdash;explanations of Freire&rsquo;s ideas and arguments which you will then use as a means of interpreting Rushmore. Imagine that your audience has not read Freire&rsquo;s essay. What ideas, arguments, and terms from Freire&rsquo;s essay will you need to carefully explain so that the audience will understand how they may be used to arrive at a new understanding of the film?
You might alternatively consider how Rushmore might be used to perform a critique of Freire&rsquo;s thinking in his essay.
For more information on writing a theoretical argument. Use the MLA format Example of Theoretical Analysis Theory Example Here is a slice of a theoretical analysis that might give you a sense of how to use the theory and provide proper context for your analysis. We might imagine discovering the following paragraph several pages into the argument:
Although Freire argues that liberation education culminates in a collective effort to change the world, Max&rsquo;s efforts in this regard fail to embrace the communitarian philosophy that Freire espouses. Freire insists that education and knowledge may only exist in dialogue&mdash;in the open exchange of ideas between equal partners engaged in a process of mutual inquiry (88). For Freire, these moments of co-inquiry inevitably lead to praxis&mdash;where the views, ideas, and values held by a community are used to transform the world into a more democratic and free society (75). While Max is keen to change the world, shaping it to his needs and wants, his praxis is always self-interested; he fails to understand Freire&rsquo;s imperatives of community, dialogue, and consensus. In essence, rather than shape the world with others, as Freire implores, Max insists on altering the world for himself alone.
Perhaps the most revealing instance of Max&rsquo;s failed praxis is his effort to construct a world-class aquarium on the Rushmore campus. [Blah, blah, blah].
A key feature of this sort of theoretical analysis is that you will use the words and terms and ideas Freire offers in his theory to help you perform the analysis of the film. So we might bring Freire in at key moments in our discussion of the aquarium to explain how what Max is doing is not what Freire would advocate and explicily demonstrate that by quoting and citing key parts of Freire&rsquo;s essay to help prove our case.
Analyzing Visual Media Analyzing Visual Media Stills from Rushmore When we analyze a film we can do much more than merely discuss the narrative arc or the dialogue. The movie is a visual medium, so how do the visual elements help to convey meaning? Costuming, gestures, body positioning, props, camera angles, lighting, framing, etc. help to construct a mood and signify meanings that we may interpret. In short, a film is a text. And when we write about film, we pay attention to how it is constructed to produce these effects by performing &ldquo;close readings&rdquo; in our analysis. We might practice by reading one or more of these stills in class:

`}),e.add({id:9,href:"/courses/writing-2/essay-2/",title:"Essay Two",content:`Essay Two: Synthesis Prompt Percy and Freire, each in their own way, ask us to consider the problem of authority that attends educational systems or the experience of learning. Write an essay that synthesizes their thinking, explaining how they both investigate the nature of this problem, examine its consequences, and offer solutions.
Use the MLA format On Synthesis As the name suggests, synthesis essays focus on combining and connecting. Your focus in a synthesis essay is to explain to your audience the ways in which two or more arguments or ideas relate to one another.
Students attempting synthesis for the first time often make the mistake of organizing their essays by source. For example, they will introduce two authors in their introduction, summarize Author A, summarize Author B, then conclude by noting the broad similarities and differences in the two authors’ thinking. This is not synthesis.
In a synthesis essay you should try to organize your essay by topic or questions at issue rather than by sources. Rather than try to summarize the essays separately, a synthesis will attempt to discover the various things that the authors discuss&mdash;the questions, ideas, and arguments they have in common&mdash;then present those things in an organized and meaningful way. Thus, your objective in a synthesis is to bring two or more distinct sources into a relationship by explaining to your reader the various ways in which the sources are in dialogue.
To begin a synthesis, ask yourself the following questions about the readings you plan to synthesize:
What are the positions, arguments, and ideas that the source materials have in common? Are the authors all concerned about the same problem(s)? Are their arguments similar or do they differ? What reasoning supports their arguments? Do they offer similar conclusions or are there significant differences?
After answering these questions exhaustively, you will be able to explain the relationship between the various authors’ arguments, comparing and contrasting their views.
Special Note Synthesis is very textual in nature: you must show explicit textual evidence for each of the claims you attribute to the other authors. Using summary, paraphrase, and quotation, compare and contrast the authors’ positions. Make sure to cite each of these appropriately. Use clear signal phrases to transition between your presentations of the various author’s ideas or works.

`}),e.add({id:10,href:"/courses/writing-3/post-apocalyptic-thoughts/",title:"Thoughts on the Post-Apocalyptic",content:`Ideas on the (Post)Apocalyptic The post-apocalyptic narrative is a fantasy or species of wish-fulfillment that expresses a desire for the end of civilization as we know it. The popularity of such films and novels suggest a range of audience responses and psychological conditions behind this wish: Economic despair and disempowering socio-economic structuring lead to a fanciful embrace of post-apocalyptic narrative as a balm, compensation, a comfort. We imagine a future where all systems of power, all hierarchies of values, all bureaucracies and governing institutions are utterly leveled, creating a landscape of pure possibility where anything is possible. A Nietzschean &ldquo;re-evaluation of all values&rdquo; begins. The rigid class system enforced by unbridgeable chasms of wealth withers away, leaving only a meritocracy based in strength, wit, and a willingness to commit violence. Your station in life is determined by your fitness, not the position to which you are born: your future is no longer predetermined by your origins. A plumber becomes the leader of the new order. Cultural artifacts (such as film and novels) function as temporary compensations for the economic hopelessness of the underclasses under global capitalism. These narratives of destruction are received as revenge fantasies. The world that has wronged the underclasses is destroyed; the economic machine that has ground them to dust is violently dismantled; the high classes are brought low and are forced to suffer poverty, deprivation, and insecurity along with the rest. Many cultural artifacts articulate a powerful nostalgia&mdash;a desire to return to a simpler time without the complexities and petty annoyances of life in the first world: no technology, no social media, no cable television, no traffic. No one looks at a screen anymore; instead we hold a hoe and cultivate a bean field. It is a return to the land&mdash;to a bucolic, pastoral existence. However, this reverie is rarely the subject of the post-apocalyptic, which concentrates on the threat that other humans pose to each other in the state of nature. These states of rural perfection are always overturned or under threat from others. In some post-apocalyptic narratives the focus is on environmental regeneration; the apocalypse can pave the way for a new earth that is healed from the pollution and destruction created by mankind. Nature returns, and throws off the dominant hand of mankind to assert its supremacy. Capitalism is destroyed. The anthropocene melts away: roads, bridges, cities, infrastructure, lie in rusty heaps. Post-apocalyptic narratives often articulate a deep conservatism that presents a nostalgic return to more &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; social arrangements or structures, particularly those related to gender roles and sexual orientation/identities. In some cases this produces fantasies of a return to frankly sexist and racist social arrangements. The post-apocalyptic narrative depicts cults of hypermasculinity that redress the &ldquo;malaise&rdquo; of the modern male&ndash;cowed by feminism, political correctness, and the social sanctions against putative masculine traits of competition, aggression, and violence. Fantasies of empowerment based in dominance, gun culture, adventure, subordination and control of others (particularly women) form. Many of these films express an incipient or perhaps secret desire to destroy civilization because it is seen as enervating and feminized, lacking in masculine values or characteristics. Fight Club might be considered a symptomatic text. In the critique of the quiche-eating beta male and the emasculated office cubicle drones, we see a nostalgic desire to return to the hard masculinity of the past paired with powerful neo-primitivist fantasies. We also see films and television with strong populist and anticapitalist features. Fight Club, Mr. Robot, all seem symptomatic here. As Tyler Durden remarks, we are &ldquo;an entire generation pumping gas.&rdquo; The trammeled underclass turns against the prevailing socio-economic structures and endeavor to destroy capitalism, which produces debt slavery. They blow up all the banks, resetting civilization to zero. #Jubilee. The post-apocalyptic signals anxiety about the loss of the symbolic traditions that previously helped us make sense of a chaotic and ambiguous universe. While our forebears inhabited a world ordered and made meaningful by a divine plan, we lack a telos; there is no longer a prevailing sense that God is at work in the wings of the world, shaping history for some future purpose, or poised to emerge deus-ex-machina to deliver us at the end. Events no longer have meaning or intent; they are merely things that happen after things that happen&mdash;an apparently discontinuous and unrelated stream of phenomena governed by nothing more than the physical rules of the universe and the haphazard, ephemeral agency of human beings. Progress is an illusion. The zombie apocalypse genre is particularly symptomatic as it features an inversion of the Christian resurrection: the dead rise again and walk the earth without salvation.
A knowledge economy emerges that is centered on the forgotten practices required for the bare comforts of the human animal. Such basic, practical know-how has been so completely outsourced to technology or service industry that only a few possess the ability to: make fires, hunt for food, clean game, grow food, build shelters from raw materials, etc. The apocalypse reveals just how tenuous and interconnected the various systems are that provide for our basic needs in the present world. Foxfire books are used a currency. In other cultural domains we see the popularity of television shows based in survival, where we vicariously experience the wilderness or &ldquo;prep&rdquo; for various doomsday scenarios.
Films where climate change is the main agent of the apocalypse often use the impending disaster to show how, at long last, humans can put aside their politics or nationalism to join together as human beings to defend civilization from a shared disaster. Alternatively, films where a disease outbreak precipitates the crisis often figure mankind as irredeemable.
Mystery returns again to a world that had become typified by frictionless access to knowledge and the discovery of information. No longer can you: search wikipedia for a fact, connect with distant family and friends, etc. The world is now shaped by rumor, myth, sham spiritualism, magic, cults of personality; distance is an insuperable barrier to communication, organization, awareness. The universe shrinks to the local&ndash;to the modest circle accessible to the human senses. *But in truth, this is kind of bullshit, because Facebook has almost single-handedly returned us to a profoundly insular echo chamber bepopulate with chimeras, disinformation, and incitements not unlike what I described before.
Without powerful forms of surveillance, bureaucratic systems, persistent record-keeping, licensing, and various forms of oversight, the freedoms of anonymity return along with certain cognate possibilities such as the reinvention of the self or imposture.
The alien invasion narrative is an expression of a need for human solidarity on a grand, global scale in an era of fractured identity and caustic dissensus. To defeat the enemy, we must all work together and put aside our differences: race, sex, politics, national enmity. A universalism is forged in the invasion by something so radically other that all our differences are rendered trivial, illegible.
`}),e.add({id:11,href:"/courses/writing-2/wr2-syllabus-revised/",title:"Writing 2: Syllabus",content:` WR2 | Syllabus Writing 2: Education and Authority Course Description Writing 2-3 is an introduction to academic writing and research. The course prepares you for work in a scholarly environment where you will be expected to engage in inquiry, perform analysis, and communicate clearly. We will cultivate these critical practices by reading and analyzing a series of demanding texts, discussing them together, and composing responses to them in the form of essays. Shorter writing assignments will focus on a number of skills that are important for taking part in academic conversations.
During the winter term we will turn our focus to academic research. Our libraries hold an impressive array of traditional and electronic search tools as well as millions of books, journal articles, and assorted media. Although navigating this vast sea of information is intimidating, it is important that you find your way: excellent research skills are fundamental to your undergraduate training, regardless of your chosen field of study. In consideration of its importance, we will spend a significant amount of time learning how to use our library effectively.

Academic Honesty All work submitted in this course must be your own and be written exclusively for this course. The use of sources (ideas, quotations, paraphrase) must be properly documented. Please read the Academic Honor Principle for more information about the dire consequences of plagiarism. If you are confused about when or how to cite information, please consult the course handbook or ask me about it before submitting your work.
Since all work submitted for this course must be your own, the use of any artificial intelligence is not allowed. Any use of a LLM-based AI to outline, write, or edit assignments of any kind is an academic integrity violation. These AI programs include, but are not limited to, bots like ChatGPT, Bard, and Claude or AI-based writing assistant tools like Grammarly, Quillbot, and WordTune.
Before we consider using any new tool or technology, we should ask ourselves whether it contributes to the overall purpose of education. While Generative AI certainly has a place in many fields and disciplines in varying degrees, I believe that it is fundamentally in conflict with the goals of the writing classroom. These goals include the development of critical thinking, metacritical analysis (thinking about our thinking), information literacy, and research skills. These new technologies are designed to give answers, not encourage us to develop understanding or skill. Please know that these are not the ravings of some grumpy, out-of-touch old man. I have reasons.

Attendance Policy Regular attendance is expected. Bracketing religious observance, severe illness, or personal tragedy, no more than three unexcused absences in a single term will be acceptable for this course. This policy applies to regular class meetings, assigned X hours, and TA meetings. Four or more unexcused absences may result in repercussions ranging from significant reduction in GPA to failure of the course. If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with me beforehand to discuss appropriate accommodations.
Pandemic exceptions to the attendance policy: There will be no penalty for missing class due to COVID-19 illness or its prevention. If you miss a class or a TA session due to illness or its prevention, please email me to explain and receive makeup information. Typical Weekly Workflow Here is a list of the typical assignments and activities that we will do each week:
Before we meet to discuss a reading as a class, each of you should carefully read and critically engage the text on your own&mdash;interrogating, analyzing, and questioning the arguments, ideas, and assumptions you discover there.
As you read, I ask that you annotate the text&mdash;that is, mark up the text by adding meaningful symbols, marginal notes, and questions on the document itself. Note: this requires that you print out the text before you begin reading it. Bring this annotated copy of the reading with you to class to help you engage in the group discussion and analysis.
After making your annotations, take critical notes on the text in a separate document. These notes will be valuable to you later, when you write your essays.
After annotating and taking notes, contribute to Hive&mdash;our open-source repository of notes, ideas, and questions about our course readings.
The following three numbered sections explain these practices in more detail:
I. Annotating Texts Rather than use a laptop or tablet to read our course readings, I ask that you print them out and annotate them as part of your preparations for class. Annotation refers to the process of marking up a text by adding your own words and symbols to the document itself. There is no right or wrong way to mark up a text, but you should develop a system that you are comfortable with and try to stick with it. Your objective in annotation is to flag the key elements of a piece of writing&mdash;the thesis, argumentative claims, and pieces of evidence. In addition, use the margins of the text to ask questions, make brief notes, indicate confusion, define unfamiliar terms, and make connections to other texts. This kind of work serves two purposes: first, it helps you maintain a critical focus as you read; second, it helps you later if the text must be used for study or your own writing. If you plan on being successful in college, the ability to rigorously annotate texts is perhaps the most helpful and important skill you can develop.
It is not required to print out and annotate readings from the Open Handbook. Further advice and caveats about annotation may be found in the &ldquo;Annotation and Critical Reading&rdquo; chapter of the Open Handbook. II. Critical Reading Notes Create a document for composing critical notes dedicated to each reading. You may prefer to write by hand, although most students make notes using electronic means. (I presently use something called Obsidian to create my own personal knowledge base). Either way, take detailed notes on each of our course texts. Since you will write essays about these texts, these notes will be of significant help to you later. Your aims here should be to:
Reduce the entire argument to its bare essentials using paraphrase, summary, and selective quotation&mdash;carefully documenting page numbers during this activity.
Interrogate the text by asking questions, raising objections, and making observations.
Connect and compare the reading to others we have read.
Define any unfamiliar terms and link the text to any outside research you perform.
At the end of this rigorous process you should have a simplified version of the essay as well as a number of critical observations, questions, and ideas that emerged in the process of reading.
For more detailed information on the creation and purpose of these notes, read the chapter on &ldquo;Critical Notes&rdquo; in the Open Handbook. III. Contribute to Hive Hive is an open-source repository containing notes, ideas, and questions about our course readings and class discussions. We will build this resource together as a class&mdash;sharing the work of interpreting, analyzing, and questioning the complex course readings we encounter.
Our objective for Hive is to explore meaning, discover argumentative structures, evaluate supporting evidence, ask probing questions, connect to other readings, link to relevant resources, and think critically about the implications of a text. The “hive mind” is capable of discovering and creating far more than any one individual. With luck, Hive will become a central resource in our class discussions and an indispensable aid to you as you craft your essays.
You might contribute to Hive by doing some of the following tasks:
Help create a simplified version of the text’s argumentative structure by presenting an ordered list of claims, reasons, and evidence.
Ask a question about a difficult passage in the text or offer an answer to one posed by another student.
Define difficult vocabulary.
Flag a key portion of the essay that seems worthy of discussion or analysis and explain why it seems significant, or build on the thought of another student who has done so.
Make a connection between an idea found in one text with others we have read in class (or elsewhere).
Constructively question, respond, or correct the ideas or work of another student.
We will use a shared Google drive and Google docs to create the Hive resource. Each reading in the syllabus has a corresponding Google document within the shared drive which we will use to collectively explore and interrogate the text.
When you make your contributions to Hive, please ensure that you post in the Google drive associated with your course section. To make this easier, I have flagged the links to each section with an exponential notation, as in the example below:
1 : Hive page for section 1 @ 11 hour 2 : Hive page for section 2 @ 12 hour You must use your Dartmouth login credentials to access the drive, not your personal Gmail account. Please authenticate using this G-Suite link: https://google.dartmouth.edu/
Formal Papers Students will submit three formal essays and several smaller writing assignments in response to our readings and class discussions. The formal essays focus on core features of academic writing: argumentation, synthesis, close reading, and theoretical analysis. You must compose a minimum of 20 total pages for these formal essays; however, in most cases you will decide the number of pages to turn in for each assignment. The exact nature and objective of each assignment will be explained in greater detail throughout the course of the term.
Formatting: During the fall term papers must be submitted in the MLA style; in the winter term we will transition to the Chicago style. Information on these styles may be found in the Open Handbook.
Revisions: It is my practice to return essay drafts to you within one week. Afterward, you will have a minimum of one week to revise your writing. During this two-week revision cycle please feel free to drop by my office hours (or make an appointment) to go over your writing or discuss your ideas.
Grading Decades of research on grading concludes that it is counterproductive, even harmful, to the process of education. If you care to examine it for yourself, Alfie Kohn has conveniently summarized the key findings of this scholarship.
For the reasons described by Kohn (and other ones we will explore together), this class will not feature traditional letter grades for evaluation. To be sure, I will evaluate your writing and give you rigorous feedback on how to improve. You will receive similar feedback from your colleagues in the class. And you will also perform reflective self-evaluation of your writing and thinking. But at no point will this complex, important work be reduced to a percentage or letter grade.
At the end of the term we will reflect together on your progress, effort, participation, and performance; we will decide together what final grade to enter into Banner. This discussion about your performance in the class will involve our mutual reflection on the following topics:
Participation Attendance Collaboration and sharing Late, incomplete, missing work Growth Effort This list was partially inspired by the grading contract in Asao B. Inoue&rsquo;s Labor-based Grading Contracts.
To earn this right (and pass the course), all assignments must be completed and a solid attendance record must be kept. Help With Your Writing There are many sources of help for your writing assignments. I am happy to meet with you all term during my office hours or by appointment. Each of you will meet with our TA for 45 minutes per week to go over your writing and plan revision.
If you require further help, the Dartmouth Writing Center is a free support service that is dedicated to helping students through all stages of the writing process and at any point in their undergraduate careers. In one-on-one appointments, peer tutors use facilitative approaches to engage students in active dialogue about writing and help them grow as writers. Tutors can help students develop strategies for generating ideas, find and evaluate research sources, outline and organize information, and revise completed drafts. Students may schedule an appointment with a peer tutor by visiting Dartmouth Writing Center website.
Students With Disabilities Students requesting disability-related accommodations and services for this course are required to register with Student Accessibility Services (SAS; Getting Started with SAS webpage; student.accessibility.services@dartmouth.edu; 1-603-646-9900) and to request that an accommodation email be sent to me in advance of the need for an accommodation. Then, students should schedule a follow-up meeting with me to determine relevant details such as what role SAS or its Testing Center may play in accommodation implementation. This process works best for everyone when completed as early in the quarter as possible. If students have questions about whether they are eligible for accommodations or have concerns about the implementation of their accommodations, they should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions will remain confidential.
Mental Health &amp; Wellbeing The academic environment is challenging, our terms are intensive, and classes are not the only demanding part of your life. There are a number of resources available to you on campus to support your wellness, including:
Your undergraduate dean The Counseling Center The Student Wellness Center The student-led Dartmouth Mental Health Union The student-led Sexual Assault Peer Alliance (SAPAs) Please make me aware of anything that will hinder your success in this course.

You must compose a minimum of 20 total pages for these formal essays; however, in most cases you will decide the number of pages to turn in for each assignment. The exact nature and objective of each assignment will be explained in greater detail throughout the course of the term.
Formatting: During the fall term papers must be submitted in the MLA style; in the winter term we will transition to the Chicago style. Information on these styles may be found in the Open Handbook.
Revisions: It is my practice to return essay drafts to you within one week. Afterward, you will have a minimum of one week to revise your writing. During this two-week revision cycle please feel free to drop by my office hours (or make an appointment) to go over your writing or discuss your ideas.
Grading Decades of research on grading concludes that it is counterproductive, even harmful, to the process of education. If you care to examine it for yourself, Alfie Kohn has conveniently summarized the key findings of this scholarship.
For the reasons described by Kohn (and other ones we will explore together), this class will not feature traditional letter grades for evaluation. To be sure, I will evaluate your writing and give you rigorous feedback on how to improve. You will receive similar feedback from your colleagues in the class. And you will also perform reflective self-evaluation of your writing and thinking. But at no point will this complex, important work be reduced to a percentage or letter grade.
At the end of the term we will reflect together on your progress, effort, participation, and performance; we will decide together what final grade to enter into Banner. This discussion about your performance in the class will involve our mutual reflection on the following topics:
Participation Attendance Collaboration and sharing Late, incomplete, missing work Growth Effort This list was partially inspired by the grading contract in Asao B. Inoue&rsquo;s Labor-based Grading Contracts.
To earn this right (and pass the course), all assignments must be completed and a solid attendance record must be kept. Help With Your Writing There are many sources of help for your writing assignments. I am happy to meet with you all term during my office hours or by appointment. Each of you will meet with our TA for 45 minutes per week to go over your writing and plan revision.
If you require further help, the Dartmouth Writing Center is a free support service that is dedicated to helping students through all stages of the writing process and at any point in their undergraduate careers. In one-on-one appointments, peer tutors use facilitative approaches to engage students in active dialogue about writing and help them grow as writers. Tutors can help students develop strategies for generating ideas, find and evaluate research sources, outline and organize information, and revise completed drafts. Students may schedule an appointment with a peer tutor by visiting Dartmouth Writing Center website.
Students With Disabilities Students requesting disability-related accommodations and services for this course are required to register with Student Accessibility Services (SAS; Getting Started with SAS webpage; student.accessibility.services@dartmouth.edu; 1-603-646-9900) and to request that an accommodation email be sent to me in advance of the need for an accommodation. Then, students should schedule a follow-up meeting with me to determine relevant details such as what role SAS or its Testing Center may play in accommodation implementation. This process works best for everyone when completed as early in the quarter as possible. If students have questions about whether they are eligible for accommodations or have concerns about the implementation of their accommodations, they should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions will remain confidential.
Mental Health &amp; Wellbeing The academic environment is challenging, our terms are intensive, and classes are not the only demanding part of your life. There are a number of resources available to you on campus to support your wellness, including:
Your undergraduate dean The Counseling Center The Student Wellness Center The student-led Dartmouth Mental Health Union The student-led Sexual Assault Peer Alliance (SAPAs) Please make me aware of anything that will hinder your success in this course.

Why do we produce novels, films, and other forms of art that contemplate the end of humanity? Scholars from many disciplines have offered theories about the appeal and meaning of such spectacles of apocalyptic destruction. We will read some of this critical literature, examining views from disciplines such as psychology, sociology, cultural studies, and religion. In addition to these assigned readings, each of you will engage in your own original process of inquiry on a related topic of your choosing. You will present your findings frequently to the community of scholars in our class, sharing and discussing your research discoveries and insights. Ultimately, you will produce a lengthy work of original scholarship that will contribute to this field of inquiry

Course Objectives Writing 3 continues our focus on inquiry, critical thinking, and argumentation. The course additionally involves an introduction to academic research. Our libraries hold an impressive collection of traditional and electronic research tools as well as hundreds of thousands of books, journal articles, and assorted media. Navigating this ocean of information can be intimidating; however, excellent research skills are fundamental to your training. Therefore, we will spend a significant amount of time learning how to perform academic research and use our library resources effectively. By the end of this course, you should be able to do the following:
Formulate research questions that may be used to guide a research process. Discover background information on a topic using reference materials. Locate books, periodicals, and other physical media within library collections. Locate electronic databases and query them with precision. Understand the importance of the process known as “peer review.” Critically evaluate sources for credibility and suitability for research. Use bibliographic software and a research journal to track and manage references. Craft a lengthy argument that contributes to an ongoing critical conversation.

Typical Weekly Workflow Here is a list of the typical assignments and activities that we will do each week:
Before we meet to discuss a reading as a class, each of you should carefully read and critically engage the text on your own&mdash;interrogating, analyzing, and questioning the arguments, ideas, and assumptions you discover there.
As you read, I ask that you annotate the text&mdash;that is, mark up the text by adding meaningful symbols, marginal notes, and questions on the document itself. Note: this requires that you print out the text before you begin reading it. Bring this annotated copy of the reading with you to class to help you engage in the group discussion and analysis.
After making your annotations, take critical notes on the text in a separate document. These notes will be valuable to you later, when you write your essays.
After annotating and taking notes, contribute to Hive&mdash;our open-source repository of notes, ideas, and questions about our course readings.
The following three numbered sections explain these practices in more detail:
I. Annotating Texts Rather than use a laptop or tablet to read our course readings, I ask that you print them out and annotate them as part of your preparations for class. Annotation refers to the process of marking up a text by adding your own words and symbols to the document itself. There is no right or wrong way to mark up a text, but you should develop a system that you are comfortable with and try to stick with it. Your objective in annotation is to flag the key elements of a piece of writing&mdash;the thesis, argumentative claims, and pieces of evidence. In addition, use the margins of the text to ask questions, make brief notes, indicate confusion, define unfamiliar terms, and make connections to other texts. This kind of work serves two purposes: first, it helps you maintain a critical focus as you read; second, it helps you later if the text must be used for study or your own writing. If you plan on being successful in college, the ability to rigorously annotate texts is perhaps the most helpful and important skill you can develop.
It is not required to print out and annotate readings from the Open Handbook. Further advice and caveats about annotation may be found in the &ldquo;Annotation and Critical Reading&rdquo; chapter of the Open Handbook. II. Critical Reading Notes Create an electronic document for composing critical notes. Take detailed notes on each reading. Since you will write essays about these texts, these notes will be of significant help to you later. Your aims here should be to 1) reduce the entire argument to its bare essentials using paraphrase, summary, and selective quotation&mdash;carefully documenting page numbers during this activity; 2) interrogate the text by asking questions, raising objections, and making observations; 3) connect and compare the reading to others we have read; 4) define any unfamiliar terms and link the text to any outside research you perform. At the end of this rigorous process you should have a simplified version of the essay as well as a number of critical observations, questions, and ideas that emerged in the process of reading.
For more detailed information on the creation and purpose of these notes, read the chapter on &ldquo;Critical Notes&rdquo; in the Open Handbook. III. Contribute to Hive Hive is an open-source repository containing notes, ideas, and questions about our course readings and class discussions. We will build this resource together as a class&mdash;sharing the work of interpreting, analyzing, and questioning the complex course readings we encounter.
Our objective for Hive is to explore meaning, discover argumentative structures, evaluate supporting evidence, ask probing questions, connect to other readings, link to relevant resources, and think critically about the implications of a text. The “hive mind” is capable of discovering and creating far more than any one individual. With luck, Hive will become a central resource in our class discussions and an indispensable aid to you as you craft your essays.
You might contribute to Hive by doing some of the following tasks:
Help create a simplified version of the text’s argumentative structure by presenting an ordered list of claims, reasons, and evidence.
Ask a question about a difficult passage in the text or offer an answer to one posed by another student.
Define difficult vocabulary.
Flag a key portion of the essay that seems worthy of discussion or analysis and explain why it seems significant, or build on the thought of another student who has done so.
Make a connection between an idea found in one text with others we have read in class (or elsewhere).
Constructively question, respond, or correct the ideas or work of another student.
We will use a shared Google drive and Google docs to create the Hive resource. Each reading in the syllabus has a corresponding Google document within the shared drive which we will use to collectively explore and interrogate the text.
When you make your contributions to Hive, please ensure that you post in the Google drive associated with your course section. To make this easier, I have flagged the links to each section with an exponential notation, as in the example below:
6 : Hive page for section 6 @ 11 hour 7 : Hive page for section 7 @ 12 hour You must use your Dartmouth login credentials to access the drive, not your personal Gmail account. Please authenticate using this G-Suite link: https://google.dartmouth.edu/
Grading Decades of research on grading concludes that it is counterproductive, even harmful, to the process of education. If you care to examine it for yourself, Alfie Kohn has conveniently summarized the key findings of this scholarship.
For the reasons described by Kohn (and ones we explored in the fall term), this class will not feature traditional letter grades for evaluation. To be sure, I will evaluate your writing and give you rigorous feedback on how to improve. You will receive similar feedback from your colleagues in the class. And you will also perform reflective self-evaluation of your writing and thinking. Ultimately, you will have to decide how best to express your ideas. But at no point will this complex, important work be reduced to a percentage or letter grade.
At the end of the term we will reflect together on your progress, effort, participation, and performance; we will decide together what final grade to enter into Banner. This discussion about your performance in the class will involve our mutual reflection on the following topics:
Participation Attendance Collaboration and sharing Late, incomplete, missing work Growth Effort This list was partially inspired by the grading contract in Asao B. Inoue&rsquo;s Labor-based Grading Contracts. Major Assignments 1. Formal Research Essay You will write one formal research essay, 15 pages or more in length. The project will involve many of the core competencies we developed in the previous term including argumentation, critical thinking, close reading, synthesis, and theoretical analysis. You may write on any topic you wish, so long as it is a contribution to our course conversation and theme. Please discuss your ideas with me before you get too far along. I am happy to meet with each of you to discuss ideas and help formulate a research plan.
The essay must be submitted in the Chicago format and contain a minimum of 15 peer-reviewed sources. 2. Research Workshops Several workshop assignments will help you gain confidence with using library resources, constructing bibliographies, and managing a large research project.
3. Presentations You will make one formal presentation at the conclusion of the term to explain your research project to our class. You will also make a number of informal presentations about your ideas, research, and writing as they evolve over the term. These informal presentations may not be announced, so be prepared to discuss your project at any time.
4. Author Page Each of you will curate a webpage dedicated to your research project. We will call this site your Author Page. You may create this page as a shared Google Doc or use the Dartmouth Journeys platform. After creating your page, link to it on the course research projects page so that we may locate it. We will use these Author Pages to view your project as it evolves over time. One of your most important responsibilities this term is to keep this page updated. Your author page should contain the following:
a short research proposal/statement of no more than 250 words. an annotated bibliography of all the sources used to construct your research project. Use permalinks to link to the book or article within the library system. a current draft of your research essay. a weekly reflective blog post about the progress of your research project (see #7 below). I have placed a model author page on the course website. 5. Contribute to Hive Hive is an open-source repository containing notes, ideas, and questions about our course readings and class discussions. We will build this resource together as a class&mdash;sharing the work of interpreting, analyzing, and questioning the complex course texts we encounter.
We will use shared Google docs to create the Hive resource. Each week containing course readings or films has a dedicated Hive document. Please make sure to contribute to the Hive document for your course section. You may distinguish between these two documents by examining the superscript notations, as in the examples below:

Make a connection between an idea found in one text with others we have read in class (or elsewhere). Constructively question, respond, or correct the ideas or work of another student. 6. Critical Reading Notes Take detailed notes on each course text. Your aim here should be to reduce the entire argument to its bare essentials using paraphrase, summary, and selective quotation. Carefully document page numbers during this activity. Interrogate the text by asking questions, raising objections, and noting observations. Connect and compare the reading to others we have read. Link to any outside research you perform and define unfamiliar terms or words. At the end of this process, you should have a simplified version of the essay as well as a number of critical observations, questions, and ideas that emerged as you read. If the text is a film, take detailed notes on elements of the film that seem significant. Don&rsquo;t forget to note the timestamp.
For more detailed information on the creation and purpose of these notes, read the chapter entitled “Annotation and Critical Reading” in the Open Handbook. 7. End-of-Week Journal Reflection Compose a weekly reflective &ldquo;blog&rdquo; post on your Author Page that details your efforts that week to further your research project. At the beginning, these posts will likely be searching, inarticulate musings as you think out loud about something you&rsquo;d like to research. However, as your research intensifies and comes into focus, these posts should begin to include the steps that you took that week to further the project in some way. What kind of research problems or difficulties did you encounter? What sources did you locate? How is the project evolving as you read and think more deeply on your subject? In essence, I would like you to blog your experiences as a novice researcher engaged in your first big research project. Significantly: the things you say in your posts will help me, the teaching assistant, and your colleagues assist you with your project.
Help With Your Writing There are many sources of help for your writing assignments. I am happy to meet with you all term during my office hours or by appointment. Each of you will meet with our TA for 45 minutes per week to go over your writing and plan revision. If you require further help, the RWIT program offers excellent peer tutoring on all phases of the writing process&mdash;from generating ideas to formal citation.
Required Conference Each of you must attend a brief conference with me and our teaching assistant during the first two weeks of class. During this meeting we will discuss the Fall Reflection and Review assignment you completed last fall.
The meeting is also designed to discuss any concerns that you may have about the fall term or any goals that you may have going forward into the winter term. If there are particular things you would like to work on in your writing, please come prepared to discuss them.
To sign up for a session, use the schedule here. All meetings will be held in my office hour Zoom room. Students With Disabilities All students are entitled to full access to this course, regardless of disability. If you have a disability and anticipate needing accommodations in this course, please contact me as soon as possible to arrange a confidential meeting. Students requiring disability-related services must register with the Student Accessibility Services office. Once SAS has authorized services, students must show the originally signed SAS Services and Consent Form and/or a letter on SAS letterhead to me. If you have questions about whether you qualify to receive academic adjustments and services, you should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions will remain confidential.

Submit an end-of-week reflection to your Author Page. 3 - Disaster, Apocalypse, and the State of Nature Philosophers and social scientists have attempted to explain the origins of civilization and the rise of the modern state for centuries. A key concept in this conversation is the “state of nature,” a hypothetical condition where human beings lived without government. In this primitive state there is no law or authority, only anarchy and the pervasive threat of violence. Thinkers of the past such as Hobbes, Rousseau, and Locke used this hypothetical condition to explain why the state of nature no longer exists and how civilized orders came to be. Today, however, many writers, filmmakers, and social scientists imagine apocalyptic scenarios of disaster wherein society regresses again to chaotic states of nature. Why do we produce such imaginings? What purpose(s) do they serve? And why have these narratives become so prominent of late?

During these moments of extreme social stress, cultures transmute fear, anxiety, or dread into popular art forms such as novels or films. Thus, by examining popular media produced during these particular historical moments we are afforded a glimpse of how a culture worked through difficult social problems, reacted to challenges to its foundational values, and related to its various “Others.” In this section we will examine two films, The Last Man on Earth (1964) and I Am Legend (2007), both adaptations of Richard Mattheson’s 1954 novel I Am Legend. What cultural anxieties or problems do these films articulate? What social solutions do they seem to offer? Significantly, how do the differences between these two films provide a metric for measuring the evolving concerns of America from the 1960s to today?

&mdash;Robin Wood
Vampires, werewolves, and Frankenstein are all monsters of European extraction; the zombie, however, was made in America. This begs several questions. Why was the zombie born here rather than someplace else? What is it about the Americas and their history that made the figure of the zombie possible and popular? What does it say about us and our culture that we have created precisely this type of monster? In this section we will attempt to answer these questions by tracing the evolution of the zombie—from its origins in the slave-based plantation cultures of the Americas through modern interpretations of the figure in contemporary literature and film. Significantly, the zombie of today differs markedly from its precursors in the cinema of the 30s, 40s, and 50s. In these earlier films the zombie was a figure within an imperialist discourse that expressed racist ideologies and the anxieties of post-slavery cultures throughout the Americas. However, just as the figure of the zombie had nearly been forgotten, a new form of the creature appeared in 1968 in George Romero’s Night of the Living Dead. No longer was the zombie a folkloric figure born of the struggle between master and slave; now it was an mindless, cannibalistic creature that stalked the countryside in swarms, mindlessly searching for human flesh. How do we account for this sudden transformation of the zombie? What cultural “work” did the zombie perform?

Research Essay Draft I (3-5 pages). 7 - TEOTWAWKI: Prepping for the End Recent years have seen an explosion of “reality” television programming based in survival skills or challenges. Popular shows in this regard include game shows like Survivor and adventure shows like Man vs. Wild and Survivorman. Newer programming includes the Discovery Channel’s Dude, You’re Screwed, Alaska Bush People, Dual Survival, and the rather prurient Naked and Afraid. While these shows give viewers the vicarious thrill of braving the wilderness from the comfort of their armchairs, there has recently been an explosion in real survivalist culture, known as “prepping.” Preppers build bomb shelters and other fortifications where they stockpile food, supplies, firearms, and ammunition in preparation for TEOTWAWKI: The end of the world as we know it. A number of shows have emerged in response: Doomsday Preppers, Doomsday Castle, and Doomsday Bunker. The list of prepper fears is long: generalized civil unrest, total social collapse, global weather catastrophes, the return of Christ, peak oil, attacks using EMPs, and, of course, zombies. Are these views largely fueled by paranoia or a desire for self-reliance? Do these fears and anxieties signify some larger, unarticulated criticism or anxiety about modernity or capitalism?

In particular, Nixon’s focus in his influential work Slow Violence is on climate disaster: the slow-moving catastrophes of rising sea levels, mounting greenhouse gasses, toxic waste, nuclear accidents, deforestation, and acidifying oceans. These catastrophes, Nixon argues, are difficult to apprehend or represent in narrative form because they take place over years, decades, lifetimes, generations; as “spectacle deficient” events, they struggle for representation in a media environment that is biased toward more sensational forms of violence. Yet, these forms of ecocide are forms of violence surely, ones that remain invisible to many of us because they principally affect the impoverished and forgotten global poor. How can we recalibrate our perceptions to cognize these forms of slow violence? How do we convert “slow violence” into narrative form so that we can communicate its dangers, raise public awareness, and mobilize efforts for change?

Why do we produce novels, films, and other forms of art that contemplate the end of humanity? Scholars from many disciplines have offered theories about the appeal and meaning of such spectacles of apocalyptic destruction. We will read some of this critical literature, examining views from disciplines such as psychology, sociology, cultural studies, and religion. In addition to these assigned readings, each of you will engage in your own original process of inquiry on a related topic of your choosing. You will present your findings frequently to the community of scholars in our class, sharing and discussing your research discoveries and insights. Ultimately, you will produce a lengthy work of original scholarship that will contribute to this field of inquiry.

The course additionally involves an introduction to academic research. Our libraries hold an impressive collection of traditional and electronic research tools as well as hundreds of thousands of books, journal articles, and assorted media. Navigating this ocean of information can be intimidating; however, excellent research skills are fundamental to your training. Therefore, we will spend a significant amount of time learning how to perform academic research and use our library resources effectively. By the end of this course, you should be able to do the following:
Formulate research questions that may be used to guide a research process. Discover background information on a topic using reference materials. Locate books, periodicals, and other physical media within library collections. Locate electronic databases and query them with precision. Understand the importance of the process known as “peer review.” Critically evaluate sources for credibility and suitability for research. Use bibliographic software and a research journal to track and manage references. Craft a lengthy argument that contributes to an ongoing critical conversation.

Typical Weekly Workflow Here is a list of the typical assignments and activities that we will do each week:
Before we meet to discuss a reading as a class, each of you should carefully read and critically engage the text on your own&mdash;interrogating, analyzing, and questioning the arguments, ideas, and assumptions you discover there.
As you read, I ask that you annotate the text&mdash;that is, mark up the text by adding meaningful symbols, marginal notes, and questions on the document itself. Note: this requires that you print out the text before you begin reading it. Bring this annotated copy of the reading with you to class to help you engage in the group discussion and analysis.
After making your annotations, take critical notes on the text in a separate document. These notes will be valuable to you later, when you write your essays.
After annotating and taking notes, contribute to Hive&mdash;our open-source repository of notes, ideas, and questions about our course readings.
The following three numbered sections explain these practices in more detail:
I. Annotating Texts Rather than use a laptop or tablet to read our course readings, I ask that you print them out and annotate them as part of your preparations for class. Annotation refers to the process of marking up a text by adding your own words and symbols to the document itself. There is no right or wrong way to mark up a text, but you should develop a system that you are comfortable with and try to stick with it. Your objective in annotation is to flag the key elements of a piece of writing&mdash;the thesis, argumentative claims, and pieces of evidence. In addition, use the margins of the text to ask questions, make brief notes, indicate confusion, define unfamiliar terms, and make connections to other texts. This kind of work serves two purposes: first, it helps you maintain a critical focus as you read; second, it helps you later if the text must be used for study or your own writing. If you plan on being successful in college, the ability to rigorously annotate texts is perhaps the most helpful and important skill you can develop.
It is not required to print out and annotate readings from the Open Handbook. Further advice and caveats about annotation may be found in the &ldquo;Annotation and Critical Reading&rdquo; chapter of the Open Handbook. II. Critical Reading Notes Take detailed notes on each reading. Since you will write essays about these texts, these notes will be of significant help to you later. Your aims here should be to 1) reduce the entire argument to its bare essentials using paraphrase, summary, and selective quotation&mdash;carefully documenting page numbers during this activity; 2) interrogate the text by asking questions, raising objections, and making observations; 3) connect and compare the reading to others we have read; 4) define any unfamiliar terms and link the text to any outside research you perform. At the end of this rigorous process you should have a simplified version of the essay as well as a number of critical observations, questions, and ideas that emerged in the process of reading.
For more detailed information on the creation and purpose of these notes, read the chapter on &ldquo;Critical Notes&rdquo; in the Open Handbook. III. Contribute to Hive Hive is an open-source repository containing notes, ideas, and questions about our course readings and class discussions. We will build this resource together as a class&mdash;sharing the work of interpreting, analyzing, and questioning the complex course readings we encounter.
Our objective for Hive is to explore meaning, discover argumentative structures, evaluate supporting evidence, ask probing questions, connect to other readings, link to relevant resources, and think critically about the implications of a text. The “hive mind” is capable of discovering and creating far more than any one individual. With luck, Hive will become a central resource in our class discussions and an indispensable aid to you as you craft your essays.
You might contribute to Hive by doing some of the following tasks:
Help create a simplified version of the text’s argumentative structure by presenting an ordered list of claims, reasons, and evidence.
Ask a question about a difficult passage in the text or offer an answer to one posed by another student.
Define difficult vocabulary.
Flag a key portion of the essay that seems worthy of discussion or analysis and explain why it seems significant, or build on the thought of another student who has done so.
Make a connection between an idea found in one text with others we have read in class (or elsewhere).
Constructively question, respond, or correct the ideas or work of another student.
We will use a shared Google drive and Google docs to create the Hive resource. Each reading in the syllabus has a corresponding Google document within the shared drive which we will use to collectively explore and interrogate the text.
When you make your contributions to Hive, please ensure that you post in the Google drive associated with your course section. To make this easier, I have flagged the links to each section with an exponential notation, as in the example below:
6 : Hive page for section 6 @ 11 hour 7 : Hive page for section 7 @ 12 hour You must use your Dartmouth login credentials to access the drive, not your personal Gmail account. Please authenticate using this G-Suite link: https://google.dartmouth.edu/
Grading Decades of research on grading concludes that it is counterproductive, even harmful, to the process of education. If you care to examine it for yourself, Alfie Kohn has conveniently summarized the key findings of this scholarship.
For the reasons described by Kohn (and ones we explored in the fall term), this class will not feature traditional letter grades for evaluation. To be sure, I will evaluate your writing and give you rigorous feedback on how to improve. You will receive similar feedback from your colleagues in the class. And you will also perform reflective self-evaluation of your writing and thinking. Ultimately, you will have to decide how best to express your ideas. But at no point will this complex, important work be reduced to a percentage or letter grade.
At the end of the term we will reflect together on your progress, effort, participation, and performance; we will decide together what final grade to enter into Banner. This discussion about your performance in the class will involve our mutual reflection on the following topics:
Participation Attendance Collaboration and sharing Late, incomplete, missing work Growth Effort This list was partially inspired by the grading contract in Asao B. Inoue&rsquo;s Labor-based Grading Contracts. NOTE: All assignments must be completed to pass the course. Major Assignments 1. Formal Research Essay You will write one formal research essay, 15 pages or more in length. The project will involve many of the core competencies we developed in the previous term including argumentation, critical thinking, close reading, synthesis, and theoretical analysis. You may write on any topic you wish, so long as it is a contribution to our course conversation and theme. Please discuss your ideas with me before you get too far along. I am happy to meet with each of you to discuss ideas and help formulate a research plan.
The essay must be submitted in the Chicago format and contain a minimum of 15 peer-reviewed sources. 2. Research Workshops Several workshop assignments will help you gain confidence with using library resources, constructing bibliographies, and managing a large research project.
3. Presentations You will make one formal presentation at the conclusion of the term to explain your research project to our class. You will also make a number of informal presentations about your ideas, research, and writing as they evolve over the term. These informal presentations may not be announced, so be prepared to discuss your project at any time.
4. Author Page Each of you will curate a webpage dedicated to your research project. We will call this site your Author Page. You may create this page as a shared Google Doc or use the Dartmouth Journeys platform. After creating your page, link to it on the course research projects page so that we may locate it. We will use these Author Pages to view your project as it evolves over time. One of your most important responsibilities this term is to keep this page updated. Your author page should contain the following:
a short research proposal/statement of no more than 250 words. an annotated bibliography of all the sources used to construct your research project. Use permalinks to link to the book or article within the library system. a current draft of your research essay. a weekly reflective blog post about the progress of your research project (see #7 below). I have created a model author page on the course website that you may use as a template. 5. Contribute to Hive Hive is an open-source repository containing notes, ideas, and questions about our course readings and class discussions. We will build this resource together as a class&mdash;sharing the work of interpreting, analyzing, and questioning the complex course texts we encounter.
Your contributions to Hive are a key element in your class participation. We will use shared Google docs to create the Hive resource. Each week containing course readings or films has a dedicated Hive document. Please make sure to contribute to the Hive document for your course section.
Instructions and ideas for Hive contributions are described in more detail above. 6. Critical Reading Notes Take detailed notes on each course text. Your aim here should be to reduce the entire argument to its bare essentials using paraphrase, summary, and selective quotation. Carefully document page numbers during this activity. Interrogate the text by asking questions, raising objections, and noting observations. Connect and compare the reading to others we have read. Link to any outside research you perform and define unfamiliar terms or words. At the end of this process, you should have a simplified version of the essay as well as a number of critical observations, questions, and ideas that emerged as you read. If the text is a film, take detailed notes on elements of the film that seem significant. Don&rsquo;t forget to note the timestamp.
For more detailed information on the creation and purpose of these notes, read the chapter entitled “Annotation and Critical Reading” in the Open Handbook. 7. End-of-Week Journal Reflection Compose a weekly reflective &ldquo;blog&rdquo; post on your Author Page that details your efforts that week to further your research project. At the beginning, these posts will likely be searching, inarticulate musings as you think through possible ideas for a research project. However, as your research intensifies and comes into focus, these posts should begin to include the steps that you took that week to further the project in some way. What kind of research problems or difficulties did you encounter? What sources did you locate? How is the project evolving as you read and think more deeply on your subject? In essence, I would like you to blog your experiences as a novice researcher engaged in your first big research project. Significantly: the things you say in your posts will help me, the teaching assistant, and your colleagues assist you with your project.
Help With Your Writing There are many sources of help for your writing assignments. I am happy to meet with you all term during my office hours or by appointment. Each of you will meet with our TA for 45 minutes per week to go over your writing and plan revision. If you require further help, the RWIT program offers excellent peer tutoring on all phases of the writing process&mdash;from generating ideas to formal citation.
Required Winter Conference Each of you must attend a brief winter conference with me and our teaching assistant during the first two weeks of class. During this meeting we will discuss the Fall Reflection and Review assignment you completed last term.
The meeting is also designed to discuss any concerns that you may have about the fall term or any goals that you may have going forward into the winter term. If there are particular things you would like to work on in your writing, please come prepared to discuss them.
To sign up for a session, use the schedule here. All meetings will be held in my office hour Zoom room (link in Canvas). Students With Disabilities Students requesting disability-related accommodations and services for this course are required to register with Student Accessibility Services (SAS; Getting Started with SAS webpage; student.accessibility.services@dartmouth.edu; 1-603-646-9900) and to request that an accommodation email be sent to me in advance of the need for an accommodation. Then, students should schedule a follow-up meeting with me to determine relevant details such as what role SAS or its Testing Center may play in accommodation implementation. This process works best for everyone when completed as early in the quarter as possible. If students have questions about whether they are eligible for accommodations or have concerns about the implementation of their accommodations, they should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions will remain confidential.
Mental Health &amp; Wellbeing The academic environment is challenging, our terms are intensive, and classes are not the only demanding part of your life. There are a number of resources available to you on campus to support your wellness, including:
Your undergraduate dean. The Counseling Center. The Student Wellness Center. The student-led Dartmouth Mental Health Union. The student-led Sexual Assault Peer Alliance (SAPAs). Please make me aware of anything that will hinder your success in this course. I will help and I will put you in touch with others who can help even more. The earlier I am aware of issues, the more I can do to assist you.

Submit an end-of-week reflection to your Author Page. 3 - Disaster, Apocalypse, &amp; the State of Nature Philosophers and social scientists have attempted to explain the origins of civilization and the rise of the modern state for centuries. A key concept in this conversation is the “state of nature,” a hypothetical condition where human beings lived without government. In this primitive state there is no law or authority, only anarchy and the pervasive threat of violence. Thinkers of the past such as Hobbes, Rousseau, and Locke used this hypothetical condition to explain why the state of nature no longer exists and how civilized orders came to be. Today, however, many writers, filmmakers, and social scientists imagine apocalyptic scenarios of disaster wherein society regresses again to chaotic states of nature. Why do we produce such imaginings? What purpose(s) do they serve? And why have these narratives become so prominent of late?

Submit an end-of-week reflection to your Author Page. Submit work for Workshop 3. 4 - The Apocalypse &amp; the Other I Cultural Studies scholars argue that post-apocalyptic narratives proliferate during periods of social crisis. During these moments of extreme social stress cultures transmute fear, anxiety, or dread into popular art forms such as novels or films. Thus, by examining popular media produced during these particular historical moments we are afforded a glimpse of how a culture worked through difficult social problems, reacted to challenges to its foundational values, and related to its various “Others.” In this section we will examine two films, The Last Man on Earth (1964) and I Am Legend (2007), both adaptations of Richard Mattheson’s 1954 novel I Am Legend. What cultural anxieties or problems do these films articulate? What social solutions do they seem to offer? Significantly, how do the differences between these two films provide a metric for measuring the evolving concerns of America from the 1960s to today?

&mdash;Robin Wood
Vampires, werewolves, and Frankenstein are all monsters of European extraction; the zombie, however, was made in America. This prompts several questions: Why was the zombie born here rather than someplace else? What is it about the Americas and their history that made the figure of the zombie possible and popular? What does it say about us and our culture that we have created precisely this type of monster? In this section we will attempt to answer these questions by tracing the evolution of the zombie—from its origins in the slave-based plantation cultures of the Americas through modern interpretations of the figure in contemporary literature and film. Significantly, the zombie of today differs markedly from its precursors in the cinema of the 30s, 40s, and 50s. In these earlier films the zombie was a figure within an imperialist discourse that expressed racist ideologies and the anxieties of post-slavery cultures throughout the Americas. However, just as the figure of the zombie had nearly been forgotten, a new form of the creature appeared in 1968 in George Romero’s Night of the Living Dead. No longer was the zombie a folkloric figure born of the struggle between master and slave; now it was an mindless, cannibalistic creature that stalked the countryside in swarms, mindlessly searching for human flesh. How do we account for this sudden transformation of the zombie? What cultural “work” did the zombie perform?

Submit an end-of-week reflection to your Author Page. 8 - TEOTWAWKI: Prepping for the End Recent years have seen an explosion of “reality” television programming based in survival skills or challenges. Popular shows in this regard include game shows like Survivor and adventure shows like Man vs. Wild and Survivorman. Newer programming includes the Discovery Channel’s Dude, You’re Screwed, Alaska Bush People, Dual Survival, and the rather prurient Naked and Afraid. While these shows give viewers the vicarious thrill of braving the wilderness from the comfort of their armchairs, there has recently been an explosion in real survivalist culture, known as “prepping.” Preppers build bomb shelters and other fortifications where they stockpile food, supplies, firearms, and ammunition in preparation for TEOTWAWKI: The end of the world as we know it. A number of shows have emerged in response: Doomsday Preppers, Doomsday Castle, and Doomsday Bunker. The list of prepper fears is long: generalized civil unrest, total social collapse, global weather catastrophes, the return of Christ, peak oil, attacks using EMPs, and, of course, zombies. Are these views largely fueled by paranoia or a desire for self-reliance? Do these fears and anxieties signify some larger, unarticulated criticism or anxiety about modernity or capitalism?

End-of-term Reflection and Self-Assessment. `}),e.add({id:15,href:"/courses/writing-3/old-syllabi/wr3-syllabus/",title:"Writing 3: Syllabus",content:` WR3 | Syllabus Post-apocalyptic Fiction, Film, and Art Course Description Why do we feel such an attraction to disaster? Why do we produce novels, films, and other forms of art that contemplate the end of humanity? Scholars from many disciplines have offered theories about the appeal and meaning of such spectacles of apocalyptic destruction. We will read some of this critical literature, examining views from disciplines such as psychology, sociology, cultural studies, and religion. In addition to these assigned readings, each of you will engage in your own original process of inquiry on a related topic of your choosing. You will present your findings frequently to the community of scholars in our class, sharing and discussing your research discoveries and insights. Ultimately, you will produce a lengthy work of original scholarship that will contribute to this field of inquiry.

The course additionally involves an introduction to academic research. Our libraries hold an impressive collection of traditional and electronic research tools as well as hundreds of thousands of books, journal articles, and assorted media. Navigating this ocean of information can be intimidating; however, excellent research skills are fundamental to your training. Therefore, we will spend a significant amount of time learning how to perform academic research and use our library resources effectively. By the end of this course, you should be able to do the following:
Formulate research questions that may be used to guide a research process. Discover background information on a topic using reference materials. Locate books, periodicals, and other physical media within library collections. Locate electronic databases and query them with precision. Understand the importance of the process known as “peer review.” Critically evaluate sources for credibility and suitability for research. Use bibliographic software and a research journal to track and manage references. Craft a lengthy argument that contributes to an ongoing critical conversation.

Typical Weekly Workflow Here is a list of the typical assignments and activities that we will do each week:
Before we meet to discuss a reading as a class, each of you should carefully read and critically engage the text on your own&mdash;interrogating, analyzing, and questioning the arguments, ideas, and assumptions you discover there.
As you read, I ask that you annotate the text&mdash;that is, mark up the text by adding meaningful symbols, marginal notes, and questions on the document itself. Note: this requires that you print out the text before you begin reading it. Bring this annotated copy of the reading with you to class to help you engage in the group discussion and analysis.
After making your annotations, take critical notes on the text in a separate document. These notes will be valuable to you later, when you write your essays.
After annotating and taking notes, contribute to Hive&mdash;our open-source repository of notes, ideas, and questions about our course readings.
The following three numbered sections explain these practices in more detail:
I. Annotating Texts Rather than use a laptop or tablet to read our course readings, I ask that you print them out and annotate them as part of your preparations for class. Annotation refers to the process of marking up a text by adding your own words and symbols to the document itself. There is no right or wrong way to mark up a text, but you should develop a system that you are comfortable with and try to stick with it. Your objective in annotation is to flag the key elements of a piece of writing&mdash;the thesis, argumentative claims, and pieces of evidence. In addition, use the margins of the text to ask questions, make brief notes, indicate confusion, define unfamiliar terms, and make connections to other texts. This kind of work serves two purposes: first, it helps you maintain a critical focus as you read; second, it helps you later if the text must be used for study or your own writing. If you plan on being successful in college, the ability to rigorously annotate texts is perhaps the most helpful and important skill you can develop.
It is not required to print out and annotate readings from the Open Handbook. Further advice and caveats about annotation may be found in the &ldquo;Annotation and Critical Reading&rdquo; chapter of the Open Handbook. II. Critical Reading Notes Take detailed notes on each reading. Since you will write essays about these texts, these notes will be of significant help to you later. Your aims here should be to 1) reduce the entire argument to its bare essentials using paraphrase, summary, and selective quotation&mdash;carefully documenting page numbers during this activity; 2) interrogate the text by asking questions, raising objections, and making observations; 3) connect and compare the reading to others we have read; 4) define any unfamiliar terms and link the text to any outside research you perform. At the end of this rigorous process you should have a simplified version of the essay as well as a number of critical observations, questions, and ideas that emerged in the process of reading.
For more detailed information on the creation and purpose of these notes, read the chapter on &ldquo;Critical Notes&rdquo; in the Open Handbook. III. Contribute to Hive Hive is an open-source repository containing notes, ideas, and questions about our course readings and class discussions. We will build this resource together as a class&mdash;sharing the work of interpreting, analyzing, and questioning the complex course readings we encounter.
Our objective for Hive is to explore meaning, discover argumentative structures, evaluate supporting evidence, ask probing questions, connect to other readings, link to relevant resources, and think critically about the implications of a text. The “hive mind” is capable of discovering and creating far more than any one individual. With luck, Hive will become a central resource in our class discussions and an indispensable aid to you as you craft your essays.
You might contribute to Hive by doing some of the following tasks:
Help create a simplified version of the text’s argumentative structure by presenting an ordered list of claims, reasons, and evidence.
Ask a question about a difficult passage in the text or offer an answer to one posed by another student.
Define difficult vocabulary.
Flag a key portion of the essay that seems worthy of discussion or analysis and explain why it seems significant, or build on the thought of another student who has done so.
Make a connection between an idea found in one text with others we have read in class (or elsewhere).
Constructively question, respond, or correct the ideas or work of another student.
We will use a shared Google drive and Google docs to create the Hive resource. Each reading in the syllabus has a corresponding Google document within the shared drive which we will use to collectively explore and interrogate the text.
When you make your contributions to Hive, please ensure that you post in the Google drive associated with your course section. To make this easier, I have flagged the links to each section with an exponential notation, as in the example below:
6 : Hive page for section 6 @ 11 hour 7 : Hive page for section 7 @ 12 hour You must use your Dartmouth login credentials to access the drive, not your personal Gmail account. Please authenticate using this G-Suite link: https://google.dartmouth.edu/
Grading Decades of research on grading concludes that it is counterproductive, even harmful, to the process of education. If you care to examine it for yourself, Alfie Kohn has conveniently summarized the key findings of this scholarship.
For the reasons described by Kohn (and ones we explored in the fall term), this class will not feature traditional letter grades for evaluation. To be sure, I will evaluate your writing and give you rigorous feedback on how to improve. You will receive similar feedback from your colleagues in the class. And you will also perform reflective self-evaluation of your writing and thinking. Ultimately, you will have to decide how best to express your ideas. But at no point will this complex, important work be reduced to a percentage or letter grade.
At the end of the term we will reflect together on your progress, effort, participation, and performance; we will decide together what final grade to enter into Banner. This discussion about your performance in the class will involve our mutual reflection on the following topics, inspired by the grading contract in Asao B. Inoue&rsquo;s Labor-based Grading Contracts:
Participation Attendance Collaboration and sharing Late, incomplete, missing work Growth Effort To pass this course all assignments must be completed and a solid attendance record must be kept. Major Assignments 1. Formal Research Essay You will write one formal research essay, 15 pages or more in length. The project will involve many of the core competencies we developed in the previous term including argumentation, critical thinking, close reading, synthesis, and theoretical analysis. You may write on any topic you wish, so long as it is a contribution to our course conversation and theme. Please discuss your ideas with me before you get too far along. I am happy to meet with each of you to discuss ideas and help formulate a research plan.
The essay must be submitted in the Chicago format and contain a minimum of 15 peer-reviewed sources. 2. Research Workshops Several workshop assignments will help you gain confidence with using library resources, constructing bibliographies, and managing a large research project.
3. Presentations You will make one formal presentation at the conclusion of the term to explain your research project to our class. You will also make a number of informal presentations about your ideas, research, and writing as they evolve over the term. These informal presentations may not be announced, so be prepared to discuss your project at any time.
4. Author Page Each of you will curate a webpage dedicated to your research project. We will call this site your Author Page. You may create this page as a shared Google Doc or use the Dartmouth Journeys platform. After creating your page, link to it on the course research projects page so that we may locate it. We will use these Author Pages to view your project as it evolves over time. One of your most important responsibilities this term is to keep this page updated. Your author page should contain the following:
a short research proposal/statement of no more than 250 words. an annotated bibliography of all the sources used to construct your research project. Use permalinks to link to the book or article within the library system. a current draft of your research essay. a weekly reflective blog post about the progress of your research project (see #7 below). I have created a model author page on the course website that you may use as a template. 5. Contribute to Hive Hive is an open-source repository containing notes, ideas, and questions about our course readings and class discussions. We will build this resource together as a class&mdash;sharing the work of interpreting, analyzing, and questioning the complex course texts we encounter.
Your contributions to Hive are a key element in your class participation. We will use shared Google docs to create the Hive resource. Each week containing course readings or films has a dedicated Hive document. Please make sure to contribute to the Hive document for your course section.
Instructions and ideas for Hive contributions are described in more detail above. 6. Critical Reading Notes Take detailed notes on each course text. Your aim here should be to reduce the entire argument to its bare essentials using paraphrase, summary, and selective quotation. Carefully document page numbers during this activity. Interrogate the text by asking questions, raising objections, and noting observations. Connect and compare the reading to others we have read. Link to any outside research you perform and define unfamiliar terms or words. At the end of this process, you should have a simplified version of the essay as well as a number of critical observations, questions, and ideas that emerged as you read. If the text is a film, take detailed notes on elements of the film that seem significant. Don&rsquo;t forget to note the timestamp.
For more detailed information on the creation and purpose of these notes, read the chapter entitled “Annotation and Critical Reading” in the Open Handbook. 7. End-of-Week Journal Reflection Compose a weekly reflective &ldquo;blog&rdquo; post on your Author Page that details your efforts that week to further your research project. At the beginning, these posts will likely be searching, inarticulate musings as you think through possible ideas for a research project. However, as your research intensifies and comes into focus, these posts should begin to include the steps that you took that week to further the project in some way. What kind of research problems or difficulties did you encounter? What sources did you locate? How is the project evolving as you read and think more deeply on your subject? In essence, I would like you to blog your experiences as a novice researcher engaged in your first big research project. Significantly: the things you say in your posts will help me, the teaching assistant, and your colleagues assist you with your project.
Help With Your Writing There are many sources of help for your writing assignments. I am happy to meet with you all term during my office hours or by appointment. Each of you will meet with our TA for 45 minutes per week to go over your writing and plan revision. If you require further help, the RWIT program offers excellent peer tutoring on all phases of the writing process&mdash;from generating ideas to formal citation.
Students With Disabilities Students requesting disability-related accommodations and services for this course are required to register with Student Accessibility Services (SAS; Getting Started with SAS webpage; student.accessibility.services@dartmouth.edu; 1-603-646-9900) and to request that an accommodation email be sent to me in advance of the need for an accommodation. Then, students should schedule a follow-up meeting with me to determine relevant details such as what role SAS or its Testing Center may play in accommodation implementation. This process works best for everyone when completed as early in the quarter as possible. If students have questions about whether they are eligible for accommodations or have concerns about the implementation of their accommodations, they should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions will remain confidential.
Mental Health &amp; Wellbeing The academic environment is challenging, our terms are intensive, and classes are not the only demanding part of your life. There are a number of resources available to you on campus to support your wellness, including:
Your undergraduate dean. The Counseling Center. The Student Wellness Center. The student-led Dartmouth Mental Health Union. The student-led Sexual Assault Peer Alliance (SAPAs). Please make me aware of anything that will hinder your success in this course. I will help and I will put you in touch with others who can help even more. The earlier I am aware of issues, the more I can do to assist you.

A key concept in this conversation is the “state of nature,” a hypothetical condition where human beings lived without government. In this primitive state there is no law or authority, only anarchy and the pervasive threat of violence. Thinkers of the past such as Hobbes, Rousseau, and Locke used this hypothetical condition to explain why the state of nature no longer exists and how civilized orders came to be. Today, however, many writers, filmmakers, and social scientists imagine apocalyptic scenarios of disaster wherein society regresses again to chaotic states of nature. Why do we produce such imaginings? What purpose(s) do they serve? And why have these narratives become so prominent of late?

Submit an end-of-week reflection to your Author Page. Submit work for Workshop 3. 4 - The Apocalypse &amp; the Other I Cultural Studies scholars argue that post-apocalyptic narratives proliferate during periods of social crisis. During these moments of extreme social stress cultures transmute fear, anxiety, or dread into popular art forms such as novels or films. Thus, by examining popular media produced during these particular historical moments we are afforded a glimpse of how a culture worked through difficult social problems, reacted to challenges to its foundational values, and related to its various “Others.” In this section we will examine two films, The Last Man on Earth (1964) and I Am Legend (2007), both adaptations of Richard Mattheson’s 1954 novel I Am Legend. What cultural anxieties or problems do these films articulate? What social solutions do they seem to offer? Significantly, how do the differences between these two films provide a metric for measuring the evolving concerns of America from the 1960s to today?

&mdash;Robin Wood
Vampires, werewolves, and Frankenstein are all monsters of European extraction; the zombie, however, was made in America. This prompts several questions: Why was the zombie born here rather than someplace else? What is it about the Americas and their history that made the figure of the zombie possible and popular? What does it say about us and our culture that we have created precisely this type of monster? In this section we will attempt to answer these questions by tracing the evolution of the zombie—from its origins in the slave-based plantation cultures of the Americas through modern interpretations of the figure in contemporary literature and film. Significantly, the zombie of today differs markedly from its precursors in the cinema of the 30s, 40s, and 50s. In these earlier films the zombie was a figure within an imperialist discourse that expressed racist ideologies and the anxieties of post-slavery cultures throughout the Americas. However, just as the figure of the zombie had nearly been forgotten, a new form of the creature appeared in 1968 in George Romero’s Night of the Living Dead. No longer was the zombie a folkloric figure born of the struggle between master and slave; now it was an mindless, cannibalistic creature that stalked the countryside in swarms, mindlessly searching for human flesh. How do we account for this sudden transformation of the zombie? What cultural “work” did the zombie perform?

Popular shows in this regard include game shows like Survivor and adventure shows like Man vs. Wild and Survivorman. Newer programming includes the Discovery Channel’s Dude, You’re Screwed, Alaska Bush People, Dual Survival, and the rather prurient Naked and Afraid. While these shows give viewers the vicarious thrill of braving the wilderness from the comfort of their armchairs, there has recently been an explosion in real survivalist culture, known as “prepping.” Preppers build bomb shelters and other fortifications where they stockpile food, supplies, firearms, and ammunition in preparation for TEOTWAWKI: The end of the world as we know it. A number of shows have emerged in response: Doomsday Preppers, Doomsday Castle, and Doomsday Bunker. The list of prepper fears is long: generalized civil unrest, total social collapse, global weather catastrophes, the return of Christ, peak oil, attacks using EMPs, and, of course, zombies. Are these views largely fueled by paranoia or a desire for self-reliance? Do these fears and anxieties signify some larger, unarticulated criticism or anxiety about modernity or capitalism?

End-of-term Reflection and Self-Assessment. `}),e.add({id:16,href:"/resources/hive/",title:"+ Hive",content:` What is Hive? Hive is an open-source repository containing notes, ideas, and questions about our course readings and class discussions. We will build this resource together as a class&mdash;sharing the work of interpreting, analyzing, and questioning the complex course readings we encounter. The &ldquo;hive mind&rdquo; is capable of discovering far more than any one individual. With luck, Hive will become a central resource in our class discussions and an indispensable aid to you as you craft your essays.
We will use a shared Google drive to create the Hive resource. You must use your Dartmouth login credentials to access the drive, not your personal Gmail account.
You may authenticate using your Dartmouth credentials at this G-Suite link: https://google.dartmouth.edu/
We will use shared Google docs to create the Hive resource. Each week containing course readings or films has one or more dedicated Hive documents that are housed in a shared Google drive folder. Each of my course sections has a dedicated drive and you will only be able to contribute to the course section of which you are a member. You may distinguish the links to these folders with the superscript notation on the link, as in the examples below:
1 : Hive page for section 1 @ 11 hour 2 : Hive page for section 2 @ 12 hour How to contribute You might contribute to Hive by doing some of the following tasks:
Help create a simplified version of the text&rsquo;s argumentative structure by presenting an ordered list of claims, reasons, and evidence in the Google Doc associated with each reading.
Ask a question about a difficult passage in the text or offer an answer to one posed by another student.
Define difficult vocabulary.
Quote a portion of the essay that seems worthy of discussion or analysis and explain why it seems significant, or build on the thought of another student who has done so.
Make a connection between an idea found in one text with others we have read in class (or elsewhere).
Constructively question, respond, or correct the ideas or work of another student.
Cite your work Although I don&rsquo;t imagine honeybees do this, I ask you to cite your individual contributions to the Hive. You may do this by using a new feature in Google Docs called smart chips. You can cite your contribution by typing the &lsquo;@&rsquo; symbol and the begin typing your Dartmouth email address until it appears in the dropdown list. Select your address and then your name will appear in the document to identify you as the contributor. The result will resemble the following: Alan Taylor.
As you contribute ideas, questions, observations, or flag key portions of the text&rsquo;s argument, don&rsquo;t forget to credit yourself for your work. This will help us later, in case we&rsquo;d like to thank you, discuss your idea, or cite you in our own writing. And a large part of your participation will be figured from your engagement within the Hive.

Alan Taylor Revanchist Masculinity in Recent Post-Apocalyptic Cinema This paper examines a strain of post-apocalyptic narrative featuring what we may call “revanchist masculinity.” This term references an increasingly strident cultural discourse that addresses a perceived crisis of modern masculinity and demands a return to patriarchal authority and so-called &ldquo;masculine values.&rdquo; Narratives of this sort revel in neo-primitivist fantasies of male empowerment based in dominance, gun culture, adventure, hyper-masculine performances, and the subordination and control of others (particularly women). Many of these films express an incipient or perhaps secret desire to totally destroy modern civilization, which is seen as enervating and effeminate, thus returning to a &ldquo;natural&rdquo; order.

`}),e.add({id:19,href:"/courses/writing-3/reading-notes/",title:"Reading Notes",content:`Disaster, Apocalypse, and the State of Nature Reading Notes Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan (1651) Men are essentially equal when all is “reckoned together.” Equal in power, equal in common sense or wisdom. We might think that we are smarter than others, but we are mostly the same. This sense of equality leads to three causes of &ldquo;quarrel&rdquo;:
COMPETITION: Because we know ourselves to be equals, we become hopeful of attaining ends, goals, possessions. However, this puts us at odds with others; when two people want the same thing, they become enemies. As a result, they attempt to “subdue” or “destroy” each other. Sometimes this is just for self-preservation; sometimes it is just out of pleasure. Thus, if you grow crops, or have a house, or money, and you are alone, without protection, someone will come and take it from you. And this invader is likewise vulnerable to someone else&ndash;perhaps someone bigger, stronger, or perhaps a bunch of people who might come to kill you and take your stuff.
DIFFIDENCE: We desire security, the “conservation” of our lives and what we need to live. This is living within the “modest bounds” of human life. In this case, we “master” only those who seek to take our lives or the things we need to live. However, there are others who are not so modest, who desire power, control over others, dominance, “conquest.” Therefore, this compels even the “modest” person to engage in the conquest of others; merely trying to defend oneself is a losing proposition. The logic of this situation demands that I take what other’s have before they take everything from me.
GLORY: Without an authority that keeps humans in “awe” with it’s power, we seek to elevate ourselves over each other for reputation.
Key summary about Hobbes’ view on the nature of mankind: “So that in the nature of man, we find three principles of quarrel. First, competition; secondly, diffidence; thirdly, glory. The first maketh men invade for gain; the second, for safety; and the third, for reputation. The first use violence, to make themselves masters of other men’s persons, wives, children, and cattle; the second, to defend them; the third, for trifles, as a word, a smile, a different opinion, and any other sign of undervalue, either direct in their persons or by reflection in their kindred, their friends, their nation, their profession, their name”.
War is a “tract of time”: War isn’t just moments of battle; war is “a tract of time, wherein the will to contend by battle is sufficiently known.” By this, I believe, Hobbes means that when we all know we are experiencing a time of war, that knowledge has consequences and introduces a new dynamic to our thinking. For example, when I encounter a stranger, the logic of war demands that I kill first and ask questions later: I know that you know; you know that I know; and I know that you know that I know that this is war. When we find ourselves in this situation, the most logical reaction is to kill everyone you encounter and take all that you see because everyone else will do the same. And even if they wouldn’t, we must act as if they would. Thus, even a reasonable and nonviolent person is forced into a stance of violence. And this has further consequences. Our behavior doesn&rsquo;t just change when we are engaged in battles. This war is like weather, a &ldquo;tract of time&rdquo; when a battle may occur at any moment unexpectedly. Thus, when we know we are in this time of war, there is no: 1) economy, 2) no planting or harvesting of food, 3) no transportation of goods, 4) no exploration, 5) no arts, or books, or culture. What exists is “continual fear, and danger of violent death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.”
The State of Nature is amoral: there is no good or evil, no notion of right or wrong, there is just a basic, violent, struggle of survival. There is no “mine” and &ldquo;thine,&rdquo; no property: just what we have as long as we can keep it.
Claire Curtis, Post-Apocalyptic Fiction and the Social Contract, “Introduction” The book is about social contract theory, the state of nature, and post-apocalyptic fiction. The main thesis is that this fiction is about our desire to “start over” (2).
This fiction describes a surviving remnant of humanity within the blank slate of the state of nature. As such, it foregrounds human motivations, human nature, the different ways that we “seek to live together” and the conflict between those two visions.
This fiction imaginatively considers the “conditions under which we would like to live” (2).
Curtis notes that this form of fiction has completely “suffused the popular culture” (3). I wonder: what does that say about our views on the civilization we’ve built? What does it suggest about us and our present-day culture that our popular art forms are so obsessed with this? This would be a cultural studies-type interpretive move.
Curtis argues that social contract theory is always “backward” looking: it attempts to justify the present civilization and state of affairs—it is a whiggish historical vantage. In that sense, it is a conservative exercise or theory. However, post-apocalyptic fiction is “forward looking” in that it imagines what could be. Thus, it is potentially “utopian” in nature. While Curtis doesn’t say this, we might just say that it is a revolutionary act to produce such imaginings in that they are implicitly a criticism of the status quo and its various social arrangements. Like social contract theory, it questions the legitimacy and inevitability of the State.
Social contract theory is dry and boring; post-apocalyptic fiction dramatizes the theory, helps us imagine it, makes it more powerful and personal (4). Post-apocalyptic fiction is cathartic, in that by seeing the fictional destruction we are purged of our fears or “awakened” to the need to prevent it. It is often a warning, a call to action—it has a political objective. Post-apocalyptic fiction provides a “useful fiction” that we may use to “come together and renegotiate our lives.” It asks the question: How do we want to live? (6).
Post-apocalyptic fiction is similar to older narratives like the utopian or pioneer text, but offers a narrative more suited for modern life.
Great quote here about the multiple purposes of post-apocalyptic fiction: It destroys all systems of order: “All hierarchies, all laws and systems for organizing people have been destroyed,” all constraints about sexuality, gender, morality. We can build the world again. They provide an opportunity to examine our civilization, our nations, our cultures and re-evaluate them. Again, this can be a radical, revolutionary act to imagine the destruction of the current order (6-7).
Curtis describes two modes of this PAF: There are dystopian fictions where there is no starting over (like in The Road), and utopian fictions where we start over again (7). This might be helpful in doing some cultural analysis. What mode is dominant at the time? What does this suggest about the culture performing the imaginings?
PAF allows us to ask: “what do we fear, what do we desire, how do we plan to allay those fears and realize those desires”? (7).
Narrative structure of Post-apocalyptic fiction: 1) White man is the hero —&gt;DESTRUCTION —&gt; He finds a companion —&gt; They encounter “the other”—&gt; THREAT —&gt; Form larger community —&gt; Connect with other communities —&gt; Defeat Others. This structure emulates the social contract theory in that it shows the need for some kind of social agreement that can govern human interests and produce outcomes that are equitable.
Purpose of social contract theory is to: 1) argue against the idea that government is natural (like divine right of kings) (10). Instead, it is a construct, something made by mankind. Thus, it can be revised, altered. This allows us to imagine what kind of world or government we would want to have in place of the existing one. 2) Offers a “mechanism” for “seeing humans as they actually are” absent some controlling authority or system of rules/laws. 3) Allows us to consider what kind of society we would like to inhabit, what kind of government we’d like to live under.
She mentions John Rawls&rsquo; idea of the “Original Position” from his Theory of Justice (1973).
Mathias Nilges, “The Aesthetics of Destruction” Representations of destruction are narratives, stories that cultures attempt to explain “the relationship between our existence and the external world” (23).
The particular form that the destruction takes is historically determined; thus we need to study that particular history if we are to understand the form it gave rise to (and understand why we find it appealing or beautiful).
Important quote: “The first step in such an analysis is to suggest that representations of destruction grow in number and popularity especially in times of (national) political, moral, and psychological uncertainty. Thus, we must analyze the beauty of such representations in relation to the specific fears, anxieties, and desires a historical period produces—psychological reactions that directly affect cultural form and our understanding of beauty” (23).
Thesis Questions: Nilges argues that there has been a large increase in the production of “(post)apocalyptic” narrative. If we examine them in the historical context of the War on Terror, what can we learn? What do these narratives reveal about our psychological condition?
He argues that these representations of destruction are &ldquo;a popular way of working through or at least highlighting psychological contradictions produced by moments of severe crisis&rdquo; (24). For example, we feared nuclear destruction or “body snatchers” during the Cold War. But now, in the post-9/11 world we see a return of the destruction narrative that focuses on things like terrorism. I’m thinking about shows like 24, Homeland, etc.
Solutions to problems and anxiety: Examining the beauty in these depictions of destruction helps us move beyond a mere description of our fears; it helps us analyze and understand “how these fears are being resolved ideologically, sociopolitically and, ultimately, culturally” (24). These representations of destruction function “primarily as a solution to the problems posed by a complex and anxiety-inducing present”(24).
Destruction is now viewed as antidote: Nilges argues that, unlike the Cold war films, when the fear was the nuclear bombs would destroy a world we loved, today we find the destruction beautiful because we see it as “an antidote to the world that produces the fears we seek to escape” (24). Translation: our views of what is beautiful are historically contingent&mdash;they change over time and are unique to particular cultures. Today, we find absolute destruction of the world beautiful because we secretly wish to leave our world. Since we fear it, we wish it destroyed so we can be free of it.
He gives examples of I am Legend and The Day After Tomorrow where the destruction is “retroactively endowed with beauty” because it makes possible a new world that is “more enjoyable than our present” (24-5).
This leads us to the historical question: what is it about today’s world that we fear or don’t like?
Globalization: After 9/11 we want to isolate ourselves; however, our economy is so entwined with the rest of the world that this is impossible.
Global Identity: We have become post-national in our identities, favoring a “citizen of the world” model of identity. However, this “stateless” identity is precisely the identity assumed by terrorists, who are stateless actors who have no national home. As a result, we fear that we are fighting our own “dark double” (28-9). As a result, Nilges argues, that our cinema and literature depict our fights against terror as losing battles. For example, Jack Bauer in 24 might catch one terrorist, but the next “day” a new terrorist plot spawns again, which he will have to battle. It is never ending.
Crisis of the white male. Heroic, white male characters from the 80s, like Die Hard’s John McClane, are useless against new threats, like cyber warfare. In the past they could save the world; but it today’s world their old bag of tricks don’t work. They appear impotent.
Rejection of social revision and pluralism: Nilges argues that current cinema narratives reject any progressive or radical suggestions about pluralism, and the acceptance of others into the human family. Instead, there is a conservatism that harkens back to more traditional arrangements. (I Am Legend is used as an example).
Dread vs. Anxiety. He argues that anxiety stems from a future that is not defined, where there is great doubt and uncertainty. Dread, on the other hand, is when you contemplate something that you know for certain will happen. Our current era is one of anxiety. The representation or narrative of destruction represents a desire to escape the anxiety of our time and return nostalgically to a past, when thing were more defined and certain (29-30).
Return to Paternalism. The age of terrorism produces a crisis of masculinity which creates a nostalgic desire to return to a more paternalistic and conservative social structure.
Hypermasculinity: This also promotes a kind of “hypermasculinity” which perhaps might relate to things like “prepping,” survivalists, increased gun ownership, spectacles of violence, etc. Returns to nature, like in Survivor, etc.

Cannibalism Click to reveal photos Since prehistoric times humans have imagined monsters. Scholars have determined that all cultures produce fantastic creatures that inspire fear or dread. But why is this so? What purpose do they serve? Significantly, the etymology of the word itself provides clues: the English word “monster” comes from the Latin monstrum, which means to “reveal” or to “warn.” What do our monsters reveal to us? What do they warn us about? And what does it signify about our culture when these monsters change or evolve? Without question, the most popular monster of the past decade is the zombie&mdash;a creature whose most salient characteristic is a mindless and insatiable cannibalistic drive. Many scholars argue that the widespread fear of cannibalism emerges during periods when distinct cultures encounter each other for the first time&mdash;such as during exploration, colonialism, or warfare. This experience of otherness registers as a threat to cultural integrity and personal identity which, in turn, is projected upon the &ldquo;Other&rdquo;.

The film is the first adaptation of the 1954 novel I Am Legend by Richard Matheson. As you may know, the film was remade again in 2007 with Will Smith (who does much more than slap people in the film). We will view both of these films and I think it is helpful to try and compare them and note how the films evolve between the two historical moments. Remember, we are thinking of these films as artifacts in the way that cultural studies scholars might. So our job is to try and historicize these artifacts by noting how they emerge at a particular historical and cultural juncture and then ask how they relate to that context. Since The Last Man on Earth emerges in 1964, we might want to review some information about the 60s. What was happening at that moment in US or world history? How is the film in dialog with that historical moment? Does the film articulate anxieties or fears or hopes about its cultural moment? Does it suggest a possible solution to the problems faced by that era? What do you think? We will do the same sort of work when we view the Will Smith version from 2007, and we will appreciate how much better special effects (and acting) became over the years.

Writing 2 Altering sources Annotation Argument analysis Argument summary Argument synthesis Bibliography | Works Cited Peer review Sentence variety Show, don&rsquo;t tell Working with sources Theoretical argument Considering audience Rhetorical analysis Writing 3 Introduction to Cultural Studies This class will frequently use a mode of analysis associated with cultural studies. This lecture provides a brief (and wholly reductive) introduction to this form of inquiry.
Introduction to Academic Research An introduction to academic research and some strategies for success. The lectures and workshops below each build on this initial description of the research process.
Workshop 1: Searching with Precision This lecture and workshop will help you learn how to query databases and catalogs with precision, saving you time and headaches.
Workshop 2: Finding Periodicals &amp; Electronic Databases This lecture will help you learn how to locate online periodicals (such as magazines and scholarly journal articles).
Workshop 3: Finding Books and other Physical Holdings in the Library This lecture will help you learn how to locate physical items in the library&rsquo;s stacks.
Workshop 4: Works Cited or Bibliography This lecture will help you gain familiarity with constructing a bibliography for a research paper or project.
Workshop 5: Cutting Corners in Research The best researchers know how to cut corners and work efficiently. This lecture presents you with some tips that will save you time.
Workshop 6: Getting Sh*t the Library Doesn&rsquo;t Have As a researcher you will encounter many problems, but one of the most annoying is discovering that some other person has rudely checked out your book. Sometimes we don&rsquo;t own a book or article that you want to read. What do you do when these things happen? You have many options that won&rsquo;t cost you a dime.
Workshop 7: Bibliographic Software / Research Journal Over your career as a student and a professional, you will make use of thousands of books, articles, and assorted media. Many of these texts will be very useful to you later, if you take the time to save and organize them now. There is an app for that.
Workshop 8: Managing Large Research Projects How do you begin when you&rsquo;ve collected a large pile of books and articles that will be parts of your research project? Often, a large collection of sources leaves you feeling paralyzed. This lecture gives you some ideas about how to process your research and start writing.
Workshop 9: What is Peer Review? How do you know if you can trust your sources? This workshop explains the process of peer-review, a form of quality control in academic publishing.
`}),e.add({id:23,href:"/resources/FAQs/",title:"+ FAQs",content:` Course FAQs 1. May I email you my essay for extra comments? No. I always give each essay draft a full set of written comments. And I&rsquo;m committed to meet with any student who would like to go over them as many times as necessary. However, I usually do not take requests for extra comments via email unless there is no other possible way a student can meet with me in an office hour or at some other scheduled time. Considering how easy it is to attach a file to an email, almost every student would seek this additional help. As a result, I would be deluged with requests for help, often at the very last minute, making it impossible for me to thoughtfully respond to them all.
I am happy to discuss your work during office hours or at other times by appointment. 2. May bring my laptop to our office meeting? Grumble, grumble&hellip;ok. In the past I&rsquo;ve said no to this question because I found that students who bring laptops to my office often type the words that I say directly into their laptops. This potentially blurs the line between critique and authorship. Since it is important that you do your own work, it is best to avoid this problem/temptation by using a hard copy. But if you can avoid this temptation, I&rsquo;m ok with your fancy technology.
3. I can&#39;t make office hours; can we meet another time? Yes! I will be happy to accommodate students whose schedules conflict with my office hours. Contact me and we can work out the details. If we are unable to find a time that works for both of us, RWIT is another excellent option.
4. May I have an extension? Sort of. Sometimes life intervenes in our plans and rudely sets us back. If you get hit by a bus or contract ebola, asking for a paper extension is a reasonable request. But generally it is a bad idea to request an extension unless you find yourself in a similarly extreme situation. Many faculty are reluctant to give extensions because of a duty to the principle of fairness: if one student is granted an extension, the other students who turned their work in on time are disadvantaged. Of course, if you have a serious emergency that prevents you from completing work, I will be happy to work out a new due date.
5. How many times can I bring my paper to you? As many as you like. But&hellip; Your professors want to help you. Really, they do. But at some point, seeking help becomes a form of dependence. Taken to extremes, your help-seeking becomes an avoidance of your own responsibility as a writer, a thinker, a student, a human.
Over the years I have had many students who bring their work to me excessively and want my approval on every edit of their written work. The students who do this just want to do well, but consider what they lose in the bargain. At some point the essay or project ceases to be the work of the student, as the line between authorship and critique first blurs and then becomes indistinguishable. The student has completely surrendered their right to think and know and argue on their own terms, blithely giving away their freedom to an authority figure in the person of their teacher.
College should be a series of experiences through which you gain ownership over your own thinking and define for yourself your ideas and values and meanings. While your teachers are here to provide feedback, critique, and assistance, you should do your own work, think your own thoughts, write your own papers, and, through those experiences, become who you are.
6. Why aren&#39;t you grading me? I want to know how well I&#39;m doing. Consider why you want this&hellip; If I told you what I thought your work was worth, would that be the right answer?
What does it say about you that you need me to tell you what your efforts amount to?
How hard did you work? Do you think you improved? What did you learn? What is the value of those things to you?
Has seeking a good grade ever made you compromise some belief that you held, however small?
Has seeking a good grade ever made your relationship with a teacher less honest and sincere?
7. What should we call you? Honorifics and such&hellip; Almost every year a student will ask me &ldquo;What do we call you?&rdquo; on the first day of classes. So how should you address your teachers at college? This is a difficult question to answer. Let&rsquo;s think about this rhetorically and consider our audience:
The Prouds All of your teachers at Dartmouth have terminal degrees in at least one academic field. Usually this means a Ph.D. They publish books and articles. They are asked to give speeches and talk on television. Some of them are legitimately famous. For some faculty this has become so central to their sense of self-worth that they will visibly cringe if you call them &ldquo;Bill&rdquo; or, even worse, &ldquo;Mr. Smith.&rdquo; Let&rsquo;s call this group the Prouds.
The Brofs A second group, although just as accomplished as the Prouds, are less dependent on their academic accomplishments to gain psychological uplift. They would actually prefer if you called them by their first name in order to better signal a desire to close the distance between teacher and pupil. Let&rsquo;s call them Brofessors or Brofs for short.
The Pseudo-Brofs A third group, perhaps the most interesting of the bunch, are the pseudo-Brofs. While they will look you directly in the eye and say &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you call me,&rdquo; or &ldquo;call me Phyllis,&rdquo; in truth (for psychological reasons too complex to go into here) they crave the honorific &ldquo;doctor&rdquo; or &ldquo;professor&rdquo; even more than the Prouds, but they are too ashamed to admit it and too cowardly to enforce it.
The Student Now, students, what does this mean for you? It means that unless you love to court danger and/or have too much integrity to submit to any form of authority, the safe move is probably to call all your teachers &ldquo;professor X&rdquo; or &ldquo;doctor X&rdquo; to avoid giving offense.
8. Do I need to print out and annotate this reading? Follow this flowchart. 9. Will we use the X hours? Nope. X hours are X-tra. They exist so that we can make up days that we miss or if we get behind for some unforeseen reason. For example, if I miss some classes due to illness, I may use the X hours to catch up and get the course back on track. Otherwise, I will use the X hour time for my office hours.
10. Are you as grumpy as this FAQ suggests? Yes. Now you kids get off my lawn!
`}),e.add({id:24,href:"/posts/on-evaluating/",title:"On Evaluating",content:`My department recently opened a dialogue about grading. This reminded me of a classic Peter Elbow essay entitled &ldquo;Ranking, Evaluating, Liking: Sorting Out Three forms of Judgment.&rdquo;
In one key passage, Elbow argues that too much of an emphasis on evaluation disrupts learning:
Most important of all, evaluation harms the climate for learning and teaching&mdash;or rather too much evaluation has this effect. That is, if we evaluate everything students write, they tend to remain tangled up in the assumption that their whole job in school is to give teachers &ldquo;what they want.&rdquo; Constant evaluation makes students worry more about psyching out the teacher than about what they are really learning. Students fall into to a kind of defensive or on-guard stance toward the teacher: a desire to hide what they don&rsquo;t understand and try to impress. This stance gets in the way of learning. (Think of the patient trying to hide symptoms from the doctor.) Most of all, constant evaluation by someone in authority makes students reluctant to take the risks that are needed for good learning&mdash;to try out hunches and trust their own judgment. Face it: if our goal is to get students to exercise their own judgment, that means exercising an immature and undeveloped judgment and making choices that are obviously wrong to us (9-10).
I take away two important insights here: 1) students need to fuck up a lot in order to learn and grow; 2) the thing that disrupts student growth is the authority of the teacher, who ranks and grades performances. If everything is evaluated for a grade then the messy, honest, vulnerable work of experimentation and exploration that is necessary for growth is replaced with a facade of competence and an unflattering dependence on the instructor.
Elbow offers an alternative vision of the writing classroom:
We see around us a widespread hunger to be evaluated that is often just as strong as the hunger to rank. Countless conditions make many of us walk around in the world wanting to ask others (especially those in authority), &ldquo;How am I doing, did I do OK?&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t think the hunger to be evaluated is as harmful as the hunger to rank, but it can get in the way of learning. For I find that the greatest and most powerful breakthroughs in learning occur when I can get myself and others to put aside this nagging, self-doubting question (&ldquo;How am I doing? How am I doing?&rdquo;)&mdash;and instead to take some chances, trust our instincts or hungers. When everything is evaluated, everything counts. Often the most powerful arena for deep learning is a kind of &ldquo;time out&rdquo; zone from the pressures of normal evaluated reality: make-believe, play, dreams&ndash;in effect, the Shakespearian forest (10).
Elsewhere in the essay Elbow is very explicit that he doesn&rsquo;t want to completely get rid of grading, although he offers no reasons why. So we might say that he offers something more akin to a day trip to the forest, where we are only temporarily free to do as we please without oversight or judgment. But I wonder, does knowing that we must soon return to the dominion of grading change how we behave in the wilds? Personally, I&rsquo;m rather taken with the idea of the writing classroom being a zone of freedom dedicated to experimentation, play, and exploration. If the presence of an authority actually does disrupt learning, then it seems important to adopt a more thoroughly sylvan pedagogy. I stopped grading writing assignments a few years ago, mostly as an emergency response to the realities of teaching during the COVID pandemic. But I wish I had done this earlier: to my mind, the deficits associated with this practice are far outweighed by the benefits.
When I inform students that I won&rsquo;t be grading their writing, they think I&rsquo;m joking; when it becomes clear that I&rsquo;m serious, they&rsquo;re stunned. Some find the idea utterly repugnant: &ldquo;How will I know how I&rsquo;m doing?&rdquo; they ask. Given the training they&rsquo;ve received day after day, week after week, for 12 years of schooling, it is a totally rational response. But I&rsquo;d like them to consider what this training and these expectations have cost them. I always respond to student objections to my grading policy with a set of rhetorical questions that I hope inspires a different way of looking at things:
If I told you what I thought your work was worth, would that be the right answer?
What does it say about you that you need me to tell you what your efforts amount to?
How hard did you work? Do you think you improved? What did you learn? What is the value of those things to you?
Has seeking a good grade ever made you compromise some belief that you held, however small?
Has seeking a good grade ever made your relationship with a teacher less honest or sincere?
How else can I make my classroom more like the forest where we played as children, where anything was possible and no one was there to make rules?

1) LIST ALL ARGUMENTS:
Identify the key arguments made in the reading. As I describe elsewhere, you should get into the habit of flagging arguments in the text during your reading as a process of critical annotation. You might choose a symbol to place in the margins of readings to identify arguments as you encounter them. I use a circle, like this: . Sometimes I put a symbol in the circle like a question mark or an exclamation point to indicate what I was thinking about the argument as I read it at the time. Do whatever works for you. One of the main skills required here is the ability to distinguish argumentative statements from the things that support them: like examples, metaphors, and evidence. In your journal, make a series of numbered statements that summarize each of the supporting arguments that you detect in the text. Essentially, construct a precise outline of the text's thesis and various supporting arguments.

Although a summary sacrifices specificity and detail in the interest of brevity, it must always remain a faithful representation of the original text.

3) QUICK RESPONSE: What part(s) of this essay gave you pause? Made you curious about something? Did it inspire some thought related or adjacent to its arguments? Were there references to persons or texts or ideas that you are unfamiliar with? Pick something particular and explain what the esssay inspired for you personally. Dig into these things: do some research or some writing about this. While the response genre will be personal in nature, it should not be without substance.

4) QUICK ARGUMENT: Find a particular argument within the essay and make an argument of your own about it. Is the writer wrong about something? What is your reasoning for disagreeing? Perhaps you have an idea about how this idea could be extended to something else that the author doesn't discuss? If you agree with the author's thinking, should we do something concrete or change something particular in our lives based on the implications of the argument?

5) CLOSE READING: A passage means what it says because the author arranged a series of words together in such a way as to produce that meaning. However, once the writing is complete, and the text is out in the world, it becomes subject to interpretation by audiences. We sometimes call these ‘readings.’ A ‘close reading’ is a decoding exercise, a detailed explanation of exactly what a passage means using only the words in the passage as evidence. What do you think this passage from the text means? What is the evidence in the text that supports your view? How far can you take the analysis? You might discover a deeper interpretation if you look up certain words in the dictionary and find less common senses of the word. You might notice the way a metaphor suggests a certain perspective on the passage or how it connects to some other theme or idea in the broader text. Embrace your inner nerd here. Write an explanation of this thinking to your audience. A close reading should not be impressionistic (‘This writing sucks!’ or ‘I love it!’); or evaluative (‘This idea is important’); instead, it should focus on simply explaining to your audience what the passage means by pointing to how the text is constructed.

These will no doubt include moments where key arguments are made; however, it may also just include certain terms, turns of phrase, or memorable language that seems to invite quotation in our own writing.

10) RHETORICAL ANALYSIS: Examine how the author chose to present their ideas, knowing that they could have chosen differently. For example, one author might write a traditional argument while another may choose to tell a story. A write might be furious, mocking, sarcastic; or, they may take the "high road" and try to win the audience with a high-minded and respectful form of discourse.

Find some path to a breakthrough. `}),e.add({id:32,href:"/courses/workshops/altering-sources/",title:"Altering Sources",content:` WR2 | Workshops Altering sources Integrating quotations from other sources is an important part of academic writing. However, doing so is rarely a simple process of cutting and pasting the words from a source into your own document. Instead, you will routinely encounter challenges during the quotation of a source that threaten the clarity and correctness of your prose. For example:
What do you do when you are writing in the present tense and the source material you are quoting uses the past tense? Simply pasting these words in without alteration will lead to odd shifts in tense.
What if the sentence you want to quote contains extraneous words or phrases that are a distraction from your intended purpose? Leaving these extra words or phrases in the quotation may lead your readers to become confused or bored.
What if a term in your quotation needs some sort of clarification so that your audience will understand what meaning you intend? Left unremarked, your readers may miss the point of your ideas or become confused.
What if you need to change the capitalization of a letter in the source text after placing it within the context of your writing? Leaving this unchanged would violate the rules of capitalization and make you appear sloppy or careless.
Issues such as these are a common problem in academic writing since the use of sources is so central to the enterprise.
So, what do you do in these situations? This exercise will introduce you to ellipsis and brackets which are used to alter source material during quotation. These are important tools to wield as you take part in academic conversations.
Source Text Source Text -From Walker Percy, &ldquo;The Loss of the Creature,&rdquo; p. 47.
Why is it almost impossible to gaze directly at the Grand Canyon under these circumstances and see it for what it is—as one picks up a strange object from one&rsquo;s back yard and gazes directly at it? It is almost impossible because the Grand Canyon, the thing as it is, has been appropriated by the symbolic complex which has already been formed in the sightseer&rsquo;s mind. Seeing the canyon under approved circumstances is seeing the symbolic complex head on. The thing is no longer the thing as it confronted the Spaniard; it is rather that which has already been formulated—by picture postcard, geography book, tourist folders, and the words Grand Canyon. As a result of this preformulation, the source of the sightseer&rsquo;s pleasure undergoes a shift. Where the wonder and delight of the Spaniard arose from his penetration of the thing itself, from a progressive discovery of depths, patterns, colors, shadows, etc., now the sightseer measures his satisfaction by the degree to which the canyon conforms to the preformed complex.

Why is it almost impossible to gaze directly at the Grand Canyon under these circumstances and see it for what it is—as one picks up a strange object from one&rsquo;s back yard and gazes directly at it? It is almost impossible because the Grand Canyon, the thing as it is, has been appropriated by the symbolic complex which has already been formed in the sightseer&rsquo;s mind. Percy alleges that it is “almost impossible” to encounter the place “because the Grand Canyon . . . has been appropriated by the symbolic complex which has already been formed in the sightseer’s mind” (47).

`}),e.add({id:33,href:"/courses/workshops/annotation/",title:"Annotation",content:` WR2 | Workshops Annotation In college you will encounter demanding texts of great complexity. You will be asked to engage these texts critically and to challenge the thinking and conclusions of others. You will also have to retain an extraordinary amount of information and recall it later. To thrive in this environment you will need to develop some new habits and strategies. The most basic, and most fundamental, of these is a formal procedure for the annotation of texts.
What is annotation? Annotation refers to the process of making meaningful marks on a text as you read it. These marks are helpful for a number of reasons that I describe in the first chapter of the Open Handbook. This chapter comes first because it is perhaps the most important new skill and habit that you can develop as a first-year student.
Annotation strategies Since you have likely never engaged a text in such a manner, here are some strategies that you might consider as you develop a process for annotation and critical reading:
Use a symbol system. Develop a system of symbols to flag important aspects of a reading. Mark significant elements within the text such as the thesis, argumentative claims, and evidence. Also note when a text references other texts, authors, or events. Note places where you become confused or uncertain; later, in a second reading, you can give extra attention to these portions of the text.
Interrogate the text. Ask probing questions back to the author in the margins of the text. Be skeptical. Be ruthless. Be rigorous. Challenge the conclusions and arguments that he or she presents by making ones of your own.
Summarize. Write keywords or make “microsummaries” in the margins next to each paragraph. Later, you will not have to re-read the entire document to find your place. These can be especially useful if you later use this text in your own writing.
Connect. Find connections between the reading and others within the course or your broader reading experience. Develop the capacity to bring other texts into dialogue with each other, imagining writing and reading as a form of social interaction.
Workshop Print out the document below and practice annotating it as if it were a paragraph from one of your course readings. What sorts of marks will you make on the text? What will you flag as important and how will you signal it? What marginal notes will you write? What questions will you ask?

During this class we will try to train our minds to uncover the argumentative structure of all that we read.
Workshop Relying on your annotations and critical notes, construct an outline of the argument found in Nicholson Baker&rsquo;s &ldquo;Changes of Mind&rdquo; essay.
Your focus in this assignment is on the essay&rsquo;s argumentative structure. What is the main conclusion that Baker wants you to accept? We can call this central claim his thesis. What other supporting claims does he make to bolster this conclusion?
Baker is a very playful writer; there is a lot of silliness and extravagant verbal excess in the essay. This makes it challenging to distinguish argumentative claims from his examples, metaphors, illustrations, and stories. Your job is to carefully sift through the essay to isolate the arguments, separating them from all the &ldquo;fluff&rdquo; and verbal pyrotechnics.
What to Do Work with a partner to create a document that simply presents Baker&rsquo;s argumentative claims as a numbered list arranged in a logical order.
`}),e.add({id:35,href:"/courses/workshops/argument-summary/",title:"Argument Summary",content:` WR2 | Workshops Argument Summary In a summary you present the ideas of another writer in condensed form. The length of a summary is dictated by your rhetorical needs, but they are always shorter than the original text. For example, the summary of a large book could be 20 pages, one paragraph, or one sentence. Although a summary sacrifices specificity and detail in the interest of brevity, it must always remain a faithful representation of the original text&rsquo;s meaning.
We will practice summary by writing one of Nicholson Baker’s argument in “Changes of Mind.&quot; Your summary should not exceed 250 words. Include all of Baker’s argumentative claims or assertions. Leave nothing out. Put nothing extra in. Remain objective: don&rsquo;t tell the audience your opinions or how you feel about Baker&rsquo;s writing or argument. Just give us the facts.
Don’t forget to provide MLA-formatted citations indicating the page number(s) of the points you summarize. Use the Open Handbook for help crafting appropriate signal phrases.
One of the main skills required here is the ability to distinguish assertions &amp; claims from examples &amp; metaphors. Given the word limit in this assignment, you should focus on presenting the former pair and not the latter pair. Just present the argument to your reader as you understand it.
Your previous work in the argument analysis workshop should be very helpful to you. Although you may worked with partners to decide what to include in the summary, you must write your own.
Common questions Can I use a quotation in a summary?
Sure, why not? Of course, you need to strike a balance. If you overdo it, the thing you write ceases to be a summary and becomes more like a tissue of quotations. But the judicious use of quotations happens in summary and paraphrase all the time. Can I use no quotations in a summary?
Sure, why not? You may choose to use nothing but your own words to explain the ideas you found in another piece of writing. It is occasionally quite valuable to offer the exact words of another writer. But that is not necessarily the case here. The important thing is that you accurately communicate the thinking of another writer under the assigned word count.

`}),e.add({id:36,href:"/courses/workshops/argument-synthesis/",title:"Argument Synthesis",content:`Argument Synthesis What is synthesis? As the name suggests, synthesis involves combining and connecting. Your focus in a synthesis essay is to explain to your audience the ways in which two or more arguments relate to each another.
To begin a synthesis, ask yourself these (and similar) questions about the readings you plan to synthesize:
What issues, topics, or problems do the source materials have in common? Are the arguments similar, or do they differ in some respects? What reasoning supports the arguments? Are there differences or similarities there? Do the texts offer similar conclusions or are there significant differences? The work of synthesis will go much more smoothly (and with much less frustration) if you first answer these questions and perform an exhaustive comparative analysis of the texts&rsquo; attributes and relationships. Just like you did earlier with the Baker essay, make a list of every argument in both essays and then notice the shared concerns, ideas, terms, reasoning.
Students attempting synthesis for the first time often make the mistake of organizing their essays by source. For example, they will introduce two authors in their introduction, summarize Author A for a few paragraphs, summarize Author B for a few paragraphs, then conclude the essay by noting the broad similarities and differences in the two authors’ thinking. This is not synthesis.
In a synthesis essay you should try to organize your essay by topic or questions at issue rather than by source. Instead of summarizing the essays separately, a synthesis will attempt to discover the various things that the authors discuss&mdash;the questions, ideas, and arguments they have in common&mdash;then present those things in an organized and meaningful way to an audience who is unfamiliar with the texts. Thus, your objective in a synthesis is to bring two or more distinct sources into a relationship by explaining to your reader the various ways in which the sources are in dialogue.
Synthesis is very textual in nature: you must show explicit textual evidence for each of the claims you attribute to the other authors. Using summary, paraphrase, and quotation, compare and contrast the authors’ positions; make sure to cite each reference a text appropriately. Use clear signal phrases to alert the reader when you transition between your presentations of the various author’s ideas or works. Workshop Walker Percy and Paulo Freire, each in their own way, ask us to consider the problem of authority within particular educational systems or pedagogical practices. Map out the various ways in which these two authors examine the same problem or set of issues. How do they describe the problem? What terms to do they use? Are these terms used to communicate a similar issue or concern? What are the effects of these problems on the human beings who &ldquo;experience&rdquo; them? What further consequences befall those who are trained in these improper forms of education? What solutions do Percy and Freire offer to this problem? Are these views compatible?
Much as you did in a previous workshop, map out all of these argumentative connections between the two texts, producing an organized list. Flag similar terms or language that can help you draw comparisons or make connections. Make sure to scrupulously cite each reference to the text so you won&rsquo;t waste time trying to find them again later.

We take notes. We do the readings. We complete the assignments. We turn in our work and receive our grade. But then we just move on. All the work product from our labors and the materials we used for learning are abandoned; ultimately, they cross the event horizon into the black hole of a computer hard drive, never to emerge again. But that essay you wrote last term, the notes you took on a scholarly article, the readings you dutifully annotated in your history class, may be very useful to you in some future project that you can’t even imagine now. Summarily tossing all of your work into the black hole forces you to start over again and again.
Successful scholars and students save all their work and preserve a record of all their reading; they return to prior work and research all the time&mdash;reshaping, repurposing, reusing, and extending prior efforts. They understand that knowledge is cumulative: it accretes and deepens over time, often by building on what came before. Most of us are really terrible at this. It&rsquo;s an unfortunate aspect of human nature to focus on the immediate task at hand and fail to plan for the future. But it is important to take a less shortsighted approach to your education and think about what you are doing here on a much longer timeline. It is impossible to know what your future self will need or be interested in, so it is best to save all you can.
Using Zotero There are many possible ways to archive your work and resources. A notebook and a filing cabinet would work fine, for example. But there are more powerful choices. One amazing project you should try out is a bibliographic manager called Zotero&mdash;a free and powerful piece of software that can help you with many aspects of your research work. Zotero not only helps you preserve an organized record of your work and reading, it is also powerful tool to help you perform research and complete some of the more annoying and time-consuming aspects of research writing. This video is a short demonstration of some of the key features of Zotero.
Workshop I am pretty sensitive about people asking me to install things on my computer. So I won&rsquo;t require that you do so. You choose your own tools. However, if Zotero seems like something that would be useful to you, install it on your machine and take it for a spin. Zotero is free, open-source, has a huge buy-in from many library systems, is easy to use, and will make your life easier. But your choice.
`}),e.add({id:38,href:"/courses/workshops/cutting-corners/",title:"Cutting Corners",content:` WR3 | Workshops Cutting Corners in Research I can&rsquo;t tell you the number of times a first-year student has waited until the other students left the classroom in order to approach me and sheepishly ask this question: &ldquo;Professor, if I get a book from the library or download an article for my research project, do I have to read the whole thing?&rdquo;
Don&rsquo;t be silly; of course not.
And I&rsquo;ll tell you a secret: professors don&rsquo;t read everything in their field(s) of study either. There is just too much information and it appears too rapidly to carefully consume it all. It&rsquo;s akin to drinking out of a fire hose. What this means is that you have to make choices. What are your priorities? Given the time and interests you have, which texts look worth a slow, patient, deeply critical reading? Professors home in on those texts and spend most of their time with them. And yet, professors somehow keep abreast of all the work happening in their field of study and still have time for family and football. How do they do that?
Professors (and very strong students) have developed extremely efficient forms of reading and related practices that can take the place of thoroughly reading a text from beginning to end. These skills are very applicable to first-year students who need to write a long research essay on an unfamiliar topic in a short 10-week term.
On Reading Ruthlessly First, let&rsquo;s stipulate that nothing can replace carefully reading a book or article from beginning to end. &ldquo;Speed reading&rdquo; is a gimmick&mdash;the scholastic version of the Shake Weight. But often there is no need to read every word of a text, especially when you are just trying to assess whether a text is even relevant to your research project. Of course, the texts that you end up relying on for your research projects must be read carefully and critically, but it is best to adopt a method of testing sources before you commit to such a deep reading. So, before you try to read something in its entirety (an activity that could take many hours or even days), try the following list of approaches to the text:
Skim the prefatory material. Scholarly books (and most nonfiction) almost always contain a page that lists the chapters and other content. It may be that, upon examining this list, you can zero in on a single chapter that is relevant to your interests and skip the rest. Similarly, academic articles sometimes contain an &ldquo;executive summary&rdquo; written by the author that gives you an overview of the entire work in a single paragraph. Looking over these materials may lead you to read the work more carefully or jettison it for something better.
Read the introduction. The introduction of many academic texts will contain a concise statement about the main argument(s) of the entire text. In scholarly books this introduction frequently includes tight summaries of each chapter. The benefit of reading these is obvious: reading (or perhaps just heavily skimming) the introduction will provide you with an excellent summary and overview of the text. Again, this may convince you to read the text more seriously or return it to circulation. Introductions also frequently contain what are known as a &ldquo;literature reviews,&rdquo; where the scholarly conversation that surrounds the particular topic in question is summarized and the contribution the book offers to this critical context is described. The other texts and authors mentioned in the literature review may be quite useful to you as well, so take note to check out or download these texts as needed.
Read the conclusion. The conclusions of books, chapters, or articles are places where the author tries to state the worth and relevance of their work. These passages are often very revealing as they tell you quite a lot about whether the text&rsquo;s earlier content will be useful or in sync with your project, arguments, and ideas.
Scan the topic sentences. One final test may be to skim the topic sentences of each paragraph in a chapter or article. Since the topic sentences generally state the paragraph&rsquo;s purpose, you can often gain important intelligence on the whole text by reading them alone.
Surgical strikes with the index. Scholarly books often contain an index at the end of the text where key terms, events, or people are listed along with a page number. With this information you can quickly scan a book for keywords that are relevant for your line of inquiry and then visit those pages of the book to see if deeper reading is merited.
Read book reviews. Academic works are often reviewed by other academics in the pages of related academic journals. If you place the book&rsquo;s title in the search field of a relevant database and use the search delimiter for &ldquo;review articles,&rdquo; you should receive a list of reviews. These reviews are usually only 2-3 pages in length, offer a precise summary of the book&rsquo;s contents, and make some evaluative remarks at the end about the book&rsquo;s value to the field of study.

`}),e.add({id:39,href:"/courses/workshops/locate-books/",title:"Finding a Book in the Library",content:` WR3 | Workshops Finding a Book in the Library Finding a book (or other physical resource) on the shelf of the library isn&rsquo;t as easy as it sounds. This is a guide to help you understand how libraries are organized and find books you need for your research.
Library Classification Systems Libraries use classification systems to organize their holdings. The most common in the English-speaking world are the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC) and the Library of Congress Classification (LCC) systems. There are a number of other library systems. In Europe, for example, you will encounter the Universal Decimal Classification (UDC) system. But like most research libraries in the US, Dartmouth&rsquo;s libraries use the Library of Congress system.
The Library of Congress organizes all knowledge into a system of 21 basic subjects, each associated with a single letter of the alphabet. For example, the letter B is used to identify philosophy, psychology, and religion. Each of these subjects may be further refined with the addition of other letters. For example, BC is the subclass for Logic and BQ is the subclass for Buddhism. These subclasses may be refined even further with an alphanumeric code that represents a very specific research focus. When all of these letters and numbers are placed in a specific order, they form a unique code that is known as the book&rsquo;s call number. The call number is listed in the book&rsquo;s entry in the library&rsquo;s catalog so that you may locate it on the shelves, or &ldquo;stacks,&rdquo; as they are known.
The Anatomy of a call number To find a book&rsquo;s location in the library stacks, you need to know its call number. The Library of Congress assigns every copyrighted book a unique call number consisting of a series of numbers and letters that help you locate them on the library&rsquo;s shelves and indicate the subject matter contained within it. A typical call number will resemble the following:
F 24 .T39 1990 Let&rsquo;s break down the call number into its constituent parts:
Call Number Name Purpose or Use F Letter line Indicates subject matter or discipline of the book and the section of the library where the book is shelved.You can examine the full list of subject classes at the Library of Congress. 24 Whole number line Indicates a narrower subtopic within a discipline or subject.Tells you which row the book is on in the stacks. .T39 Cutter line Identifies the individual book.The first letter of the Cutter line is usually the first letter of the author’s last name. 1990 Edition/Date line Tells you the book’s year of publication.May also include volume or edition information after the year. Steps to find a book on the shelf Method A Step 1: Letter Line F 24 .T39 1990 Use the letter line to determine the floor of the library where the book is shelved. The library&rsquo;s floorplan maps will help you locate the proper section. Using our example call number above, we can determine that the F section is in Stack Level A.
Step 2: Whole Number Line F 24 .T39 1990 Once on the appropriate floor, use the whole number line to find the row where the book is shelved in the stacks. Using the example call number, we will look through the stacks for the number 24. Each library floor has a floormaps to help guide you; they are available in .pdf form or are posted on the wall of each floor, near the entrance.
As you walk through the stacks, look on the ends of each row for signs describing the range of books held within the row such as the one below:
{ Use these signs to determine if a book is in the row. }
Since F 24 is within this range, our example book is in that row. Once in the proper row of shelves, proceed numerically until you find the 24s.
Step 3: Cutter Line F 24 .T39 1990 Finally, using the Cutter line, proceed alphabetically until you hit the Ts. Then proceed numerically until you find .T39, the address of our book.
The date or volume information at the end of a call number will only be useful to you if you are looking for a particular edition of a book. As you can see, the call number should be read from left to right using alphabetical and numerical orders. Thus, a book with a Subject line F would be shelved before a book with a Subject line FA. Similarly, a Cutter line that reads .T39 is shelved after .T21.
Maps of the library&rsquo;s floorplans are affixed to the walls on each floor. Free paper maps of the library are available at the circulation desk of the library. You may also consult the maps and floorplans online with your computer or smartphone.
Method B Step 1 Method B is top secret. (I will reveal it at the appropriate time).
A new update to Dartmouth&rsquo;s catalog as of 2014 allows you to simply click the &ldquo;map it&rdquo; button next to the item&rsquo;s listing in the catalog.
Clicking this button will summon a map that shows you the approximate location of the book in the library stacks.
Workshop Below, find an assigned book for you to locate in the stacks. Each of you must do the following:
Locate your book using the call number;
Take a selfie with the book (or the hole where is should be, if it is checked out),
Save the photo as a .jpg and name the photo using the number next to your name (ex: 1.jpg, 18.jpg),
Send the photo to me via this email.
If you remove the book from the shelf, please do not reshelve it yourself. Instead, drop it off at the return window at the Circulation Desk.

Examining periodicals&mdash;especially academic journals&mdash;is an important aspect of research. Since books often take a year or more to go through the process of peer review, editing, typesetting, and printing before they become available for purchase, they often do not contain the most current information. Articles, on the other hand, appear in a far shorter period of time and generally contain the most up-to-date research. For that reason, you should perform a review of journal articles on your research topic to ensure that you are aware of recent discoveries, arguments, and debates within the academic community who share your research focus.
However, a common problem for undergraduate researchers is not knowing which databases or journals are appropriate to search in for information on a particular topic. There is no shame in this: unless you are a professional scholar, it is difficult to know what the leading journals are in a particular field of study. This is also a problem for faculty performing research outside of their areas of expertise. For example, an English professor would know that the academic journal PMLA or the database JSTOR are excellent places to look for articles on Herman Melville’s novel Moby Dick, but a physicist might not know where to begin.
To solve this problem, our library has organized periodical databases by discipline in the Database Finder. You may also browse alphabetically if you know the name of the database you are looking for. This is designed to help you locate the specific journals, periodical databases, and reference materials that are appropriate for each discipline or research subject.
On a related note, don&rsquo;t get me started about the sad state of academic publishing. Workshop When you search for periodicals, it is best to choose a database that has good coverage for the discipline(s) you are working within. However, there are a few databases that have broad coverage of most fields of inquiry. These four databases could easily take you though your entire college career:
Academic Search Complete JSTOR Web of Science ProQuest Central Locate these databases at the library website with the top-level navigation: Home &gt; Research Support &gt; Databases. Alternatively, you may use the Database Finder. Open a tab in your browser for each database for testing purposes.
Each database is unique, so you will have to familiarize yourself with how it works. Poke around a bit and get the lay of the land. Get to know these databases by using a keyword search string that you associate with your research project. Use the same search strings in each of the databases and see how the results differ.
Although it is very important to use Boolean searches within the databases, many databases offer additional search limiters (generally located in the left pane as a series of check boxes) that allow you to further refine your searches. For example, I highly recommend that you check the limiter that ensures you only receive peer-reviewed sources. You may also select to receive only full-text sources or just books and articles, not newspapers or reviews. There are many options to play with to massage your search results. Try to refine your search terms with this feature in each of the databases and see what happens.
The Web of Science database offers the ability to perform what is sometimes called a &ldquo;citation chase,&rdquo; where you may systematically examine all of an article&rsquo;s citations as well as all of the articles that cite it&mdash;a critical research skill that I reference in the Introduction to Academic Research. This sort of labor can rapidly increase your collection of relevant sources.
`}),e.add({id:41,href:"/courses/workshops/inter-library-loan/",title:"Getting Books/Articles We Don't Own",content:` WR3 | Workshops Getting Sh*t the Library Doesn&rsquo;t Have A common problem in academic research is discovering that a book or article you require for a project is checked out, missing, or not owned by the library. Less commonly, you may find yourself in a global pandemic and be unable to physically visit a library to borrow books. There are a number of free services available to you when you encounter this problem.
Borrow Direct consortium A number of the best libraries in the world have formed a consortium designed to share resources and expand research opportunities for the entire academic community. As students at Dartmouth you may obtain borrowing privileges at any of the other participating libraries including Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, MIT, University of Chicago, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton, Yale, and the Center for Research Libraries.
To see if a book is available at another library, use a service called Borrow Direct. With this service you may search every library in the consortium simultaneously to see if the book you require is available at another institution. If the book is owned by another school and is not checked out at the time, you may request that the item be sent to our library. These requests usually arrive in 4 working days or less. When they arrive, you will receive an email that it is being held for you at the circulation desk. Just tell the person behind the desk that you have a &ldquo;hold&rdquo; while giving them your ID. They will get the book for you.
These texts have shorter borrowing periods. The book will arrive wrapped with a special sleeve containing information about when the book must be returned to avoid punishing fines. Borrow Direct only works for books. If you need a scholarly article, use DartDoc. DartDoc If there is a book or article you would like to read that is not available through Borrow Direct, you may request it from Dartmouth&rsquo;s interlibrary loan program, known as DartDoc.1 To request an item, visit the DartDoc webpage, select the appropriate form (article, book, book chapter, etc.), and send your request electronically to the office. Staff will request your item from another library, who will ship the book to our library through the mail. If you are requesting a book chapter or article, the donor library will send you a .pdf free of charge to your DartDoc account. Make sure to download the .pdf to your computer as they disappear after a period of time.
If you are ordering a physical book, DartDoc is often the slowest option. Requests may take up to two weeks to be fulfilled. Recall Request If a book is owned by our library, but checked out by another patron, you have one final option: a recall request. If a book is currently on loan, its catalog entry will contain a link that you may use to request a recall of the book. After you initiate a recall, the patron who has borrowed the book will receive a notice that they must return it.
I don&rsquo;t recommend using recall requests for two reasons. First, it is considered something of a researcher&rsquo;s faux pas to do so. Some researchers, angered by a recall, have been known to counter by returning the book and then immediately recalling it right back from you.2 These are the petty games academics play, and we play for keeps. Secondly, the patron will have up to two weeks to return the book in question.

One of my biggest pet peeves about Dartmouth is our absurd need to re-brand everything to make it &ldquo;Dartmouthy.&rdquo; Hence, &ldquo;interlibrary loan&rdquo;&mdash;a term comprehensible to everyone who has ever been to a library&mdash;is replaced with something completely alienating, like &ldquo;Dart-Doc.&rdquo; It is madness. It is Dartmouth. They are the same.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;

`}),e.add({id:42,href:"/courses/workshops/academic-research-intro/",title:"Intro to Academic Research",content:` WR3 | Workshops Introduction to Academic Research &ldquo;The problem is that doing scholarly work is intrinsically a mess.&rdquo;
&mdash; Kieran Healy
Perhaps the most common feature of books designed to help students do academic research is their dishonesty. These textbooks present academic research as an orderly list of procedures and tasks, each one leading logically to the next, culminating in a superbly crafted essay. This narrative generally begins with the formulation of a research question, proceeds to the gathering of background information and secondary sources, and finally to the drafting, revision, and completion of the project.
The problem is that research just doesn&rsquo;t work this way.
The narrative of the research process found in books is misleading because it often presents an idealized and simplified description of how a project is conceived, develops, and concludes. The truth of the matter is that academic research is rarely a logical, linear operation. A list of steps can never fully prepare a researcher for the nature of true inquiry&mdash;with all its serendipitous discovery and unanticipated failure. Research is a surprising, exhilarating, and fulfilling experience, but it is also a messy, recursive, and frequently frustrating one. When students try research for the first time and experience difficulty and confusion instead of an orderly march to success, they often feel as if they aren&rsquo;t good enough or smart enough to do research. So if you feel confused and overwhelmed at moments, you should know that is perfectly normal and you&rsquo;re probably doing just fine.
The most important keys for success are consistent effort over time, determination, organization, and knowing when to ask for help.
With that stated, what I describe below presents a set of steps virtually identical to what I&rsquo;ve just savagely criticized. The difference is that I won&rsquo;t pretend that following a list of procedures will somehow magically produce an exemplary research essay. Every project is different and demands something different from the researcher. Every project requires that you learn new skills and find new sources of aid. To be successful at research requires a lot of hard work, creativity, inspiration, intelligence, and help from others. These complexities are impossible to capture in a checklist. Accordingly, the information below is not a manual of procedures; it provides only a general description of the research process and some common strategies that may help you along the way.
Research (like many things in life) is something that you must do in order to learn. Mistakes and confusion are great teachers if we are patient with them&mdash;they help reveal the limits of our skills and the horizon of our knowledge. Over time, and with experience, you will gain better research instincts. It is important to try on your own, but it is nice to have someone you can ask for help when things get really tough. I am honored to be your person. And there are many others at the library who are happy to help who have specialized training that far exceeds my own.
Click here to make an appointment with a research librarian What is Research Writing? Research writing involves a number of important skills: library research, critical thinking, the evaluation of sources, and the ability to synthesize information through summary, paraphrase, and quotation. Although synthesizing the thinking of others is an important part of the research essay, in its true form the research essay strives for much more than a mere restatement of what others have said on a particular topic or question. As Jack Baker and Allen Brizee state:
A research paper is not simply an informed summary of a topic by means of primary and secondary sources. It is neither a book report nor an opinion piece nor an expository essay consisting solely of one&rsquo;s interpretation of a text nor an overview of a particular topic. Instead, it is a genre that requires one to spend time investigating and evaluating sources with the intent to offer interpretations of the texts, and not unconscious regurgitations of those sources. The goal of a research paper is not to inform the reader what others have to say about a topic, but to draw on what others have to say about a topic and engage the sources in order to thoughtfully offer a unique perspective on the issue at hand.
In high school you were perhaps asked to write research papers on predetermined topics. These essays were probably not what Baker and Brizee have in mind. Your projects were likely just reports&mdash;retellings of what other scholars or writers have said on a topic. A true research essay involves blazing a new path of inquiry where you produce original ideas, questions, and arguments. A research paper is a contribution to an ongoing conversation, a moment when you engage in dialogue with other important voices about a topic that you value.
The Academic Conversation It is helpful to imagine a research essay as taking part in an ongoing conversation. Unlike the dialogue that we have with most people in our lives, these scholarly conversations occur in print&mdash;within published, peer-reviewed books and journal articles. Some conversations are vibrant, with hundreds or even thousands of participants. Other conversations are small, involving but a few specialists. Many conversations have been going on for hundreds or even thousands of years, while other conversations have only just started. Virtually everything you might write or think about is already part of one or more of these conversations. So, even if you don&rsquo;t know it at the time, when you write about anything you are entering a conversation that already exists.
Like any good conversationalist, the author of a research paper wants to contribute his or her thoughts and opinions for the consideration of others in the conversation. But if you want to be taken seriously in the conversation, you have to know what the debates are about, who is involved in the dialogue, and what has been said previously. In short, you must remain mindful that your ideas have a context. This is why research is important: it is how you come to understand what has already been said and by whom.
The moves you make in these conversations will take many forms. We might, for example, take the idea of one scholar and build on it in some way&mdash;perhaps by extending it to a new context. Or, we might offer a new interpretation of the meaning of a particular film, historical event, or scientific experiment, distinguishing our view from the ones that already exist. During this process of articulating our own views, we often find ourselves in conflict with the thinking of others. As a result, we will often contribute to the conversation by expressing the reasons why we disagree in part or in whole with one or more of the other individuals in the conversation. On the other hand, we may also choose to bring in some ideas or words from others that we find helpful in making our own case. But, critically, our writing should never be a mere rehashing of someone else&rsquo;s work. In any case, we must remain mindful that the conversation we hope to take part in existed before we entered it, and that whatever we might say or argue has a context that must be considered. Thus, every academic paper you write will not only argue an original point or idea, it will also show how that idea emerges from an existing conversation.
The Research &ldquo;Process&rdquo; Step 1: Find a research question you would like to investigate Discovering your own research topic can be an overwhelming experience. With so many things to choose from, finding a narrow focus is often difficult. However, before you can truly begin your library research you need to find a way to narrow your field of inquiry to a small set of research questions or problems.
As you begin your research, try to keep an open mind and allow yourself to be pulled in new directions. It is important to think of the research process as something more than a mere attempt to find information on a predetermined topic or an effort to find evidence that supports an idea or belief that one already holds, an error commonly referred to as confirmation bias. Instead, research should be process of discovery where you encounter ideas and contemplate questions that you would have otherwise never imagined.
Done properly, research has the power to change us&mdash;altering our views, values, and sense of things. But you must first allow yourself to become vulnerable to new ideas and follow the evidence, wherever it goes. During any particular research project you should be prepared to change your mind and your focus many, many times. You will frequently encounter dead ends; but you will also experience the thrill of serendipitous discovery that will take you down a path you would have never considered.
Step 2: Generate some keywords that are relevant to your topic Library searching is done by querying databases with a set of keywords. Perhaps the most critical first step in research is to create a list of keywords that you associate with your question, problem, or topic. These keywords will be used during your initial searches in the library&rsquo;s catalog and databases.
Inventing good keywords often requires some metacritical thinking (thinking about your thinking). And you may need to ask someone who already knows a lot about your subject to help you with selecting your keywords. Searching with improper keywords will leave you with the impression that there is nothing in the library on your topic, which is almost certainly not the case.
To put things bluntly, if your keywords suck you will not find good sources. Significantly, you may not be able to determine the best keywords for searching until you&rsquo;ve stumbled into some good sources and use them to help you refine your search keywords. For example, a student may search the catalog to find out how nations spy on their citizens by analyzing the population&rsquo;s social media accounts. Using the word &ldquo;spy&rdquo; turns out not to be the best keyword; the keyword &ldquo;surveillance&rdquo; was far more productive. And as her knowledge grew, the student began using the names of specific countries and the names of their security agencies as keywords. So, as your knowledge deepens and you gain more insight into your chosen topic, you will constantly refine your keywords to cast more light into the darker regions of the library&rsquo;s holdings. Thus, research is an iterative, accretive process&mdash;not a linear one.
Step 3: Search for Books and Periodicals The library uses special software known as a &ldquo;discovery layer&rdquo; to aid in the searching of the its holdings. Dartmouth&rsquo;s main library search engine currently uses a discovery layer product known as Primo. While Primo will apply your keywords to the catalog to show the physical holdings the library has on site, it will simultaneously search subscription electronic databases containing journal articles, newspapers, magazines, and other media.
After you submit your search terms in the field, these items are organized by relevance, as determined by an algorithm (which may, or may not, be a good thing). After entering your keywords, you will notice ways to further refine your search by clicking on several options within the left pane of the window. To limit your search to books only, select Format &gt; Books on the left side of the page. Or limit the search to peer-reviewed articles by selecting Show Only &gt; Peer-Reviewed Content and Format &gt; Articles. There are many further ways to refine your searches, if desired. It is usually worth your time to further limit your searches in this way.
🔴️ WARNING about Primo A word of caution about Primo: while it searches the library catalog it its entirety, it does not search all of the electronic databases to which Dartmouth has a subscription. This means that if you exclusively use Primo for your searches, you will miss out on potentially vast amounts of possible sources that could be discovered through searching the various databases individually.
Step 4a: Use subject headings to systematically survey your topic Your initial keyword searches will lead to a number of books that are useful to you, but there are limits to keyword searching. It is often inefficient and inexact. This is why the Library of Congress assigns a series of subject headings and subheadings to every copyrighted book. These subject headings are an example of what is known as a controlled vocabulary in library and information science. Every book is placed within the system of categorization which means that once you find the subject headings and subheadings that are relevant to your research, you can easily find every book published on your topic. This is extremely useful as it allows for a systematic examination of your topic rather than the hodgepodge efforts through keyword searches.
You can download .pdfs of all the Library of Congress subject headings on their website.
Or you can browse the list of subject headings by searching their catalog. Choose &ldquo;SUBJECTS containing&rdquo; from the dropdown menu and enter a keyword. This will reveal every subject heading related to the topic you entered.
Step 4b: Use subject headings to find closely related books Perhaps the most helpful thing about subject headings is they are an easy means of finding additional (and closely related) sources on your topic once you have acquired one. For example, if you discover that historian Alan Taylor&rsquo;s1 book The Civil War of 1812 is an important source for your research project, you can use the book&rsquo;s subject headings to find all of the other books written on those topics in your library. As you may see from this example, the Library of Congress assigned the book the following three subject headings:
Click to see the books on these subjects held by our library: 1. United States--History--War of 1812--Social aspects
2. Ontario--History--War of 1812--Social aspects
3. Northern boundary of the United States--History--19th century
In most library catalogs these subject headings are hyperlinked; clicking on any of them leads you to a list of every other book in the library that shares that particular subject heading. Thus, if your research interest is the social aspects of the War of 1812, you can quickly find every other book the library owns on that subject by merely clicking on the hyperlinked subject heading in the catalog. Note, however, that clicking on the subject heading will only give you the books that your library owns, not the full universe of books. For that, you must do a subject heading search at the Library of Congress or a service like WorldCat.
Step 5: Read background information on your topic Since your research process will cause you to encounter a variety of unfamiliar terms, theories, people, and events, you will frequently need to stop your research and read background or reference materials to shore up your understanding. Much of the scholarship you will read is written with an audience in mind who already possess a great deal of knowledge about the topic. These writings will often refer to things in an offhanded way, trusting that the audience already knows the jargon or information in question. This can be a somewhat alienating experience for a novice in the field. For that reason, we have reference works to help orient ourselves in these critical conversations.
Thus, a research project should always involve the reading of general reference materials about the topic. Before you can ask an intelligent question about your topic or contribute to an ongoing scholarly conversation, you need to develop a working knowledge of basic facts to serve as a foundation for your project. The best way to develop this basic understanding is to examine peer-reviewed reference works such as encyclopedias, biographies, dictionaries, and other forms of reference material.
Baker-Berry library has a number of helpful reference resources in this regard. If you visit the Library Reference Resources link in the Library&rsquo;s Research Guides, you will find an impressive array of organized reference materials like bibliographies, encyclopedias, and dictionaries. Most of them are fully digitized and do not even require a trip to the library. Always start your research project with reference works and gain a basic grounding of your topic before developing your research question or thesis. For example, before you begin an essay on Iraqi feminism in the 1960s, you should read the Wikipedia article on the modern history of Iraq to get a broad sense of the context you are entering with your writing. Other helpful background information aids of note:
Wikipedia, CIA World Factbook, Oxford Reference Online, Britannica Online. A word of warning about Wikipedia (and internet sources in general): it has not been through a process of scholarly peer-review. For that reason, it is unwise to rely on Wikipedia as a source for a research project. Use Wikipedia to gain background information on your topic and lead you to other authoritative sources, but when it comes time to write your essay, use a peer-reviewed source.
Step 6: Perform citation chases 2 Many students will find a book or article that is perfect for their research project, do a celebration dance, and then return to the library catalog to use keyword searches to find more sources like it. But consider that the source you hold in your hand was substantially built from other, extremely relevant sources that are cited in the bibliography. Look at the source again: it is now a treasure map that may lead to untold riches!
When you discover books and articles that are relevant to your project, perform what is known as a &ldquo;citation chase.&rdquo; This involves examining the bibliography of the book, article, or chapter, looking for other relevant items. Find these related sources in the library and then repeat the process again. Performing a citation chase is often the best way of discovering other sources connected to your research focus&mdash;far better than using keyword searches.
Some databases, such as the multidisciplinary Web of Science, perform these citation chases automatically. Related reading:

I cannot emphasize how important this practice is. If you learn nothing else from me, take this one with you. There is probably no more powerful insight in performing research.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
`}),e.add({id:43,href:"/courses/workshops/cultural-studies/",title:"Introduction to Cultural Studies",content:` WR3 | Workshops Introduction to Cultural Studies This class will frequently use a mode of analysis associated with cultural studies. This lecture provides a brief introduction to this form of inquiry. Listen to the lecture below and afterward examine the example analysis of The Dark Knight (2008).

Example Reading So, how might we actually do a cultural studies reading of a text? Let&rsquo;s consider a specific film of interest&mdash;one of Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s Batman films, The Dark Knight (2008). The film grossed more than $533 million dollars in the US alone and over a billion worldwide, making it one of the highest-grossing films of all time. It is therefore safe to say that the film had an enormous cultural influence and appeal. In short, this was popular culture.
Let&rsquo;s consider that films function like the dreamwork of a culture (in the Freudian sense), where latent desires, fears, and anxieties are made manifest&mdash;but often in an encrypted form. Films are cultural artifacts that appear at distinct historical junctures; in them we see ideas, emotions, fears, warnings, and desires that have arisen in the cultural mind and given a particular form on the screen. While these imaginings are frequently constructed with a particular intent or purpose by their creators, these same creators are the also the products of a particular cultural formation and are subject to a variety of powerful, often unconscious, influences that shape their creations. Further complicating matters is that we, the audience, are left to interpret the meaning(s) that we see. These readings are themselves shaped by the historical, social, and ideological contexts of the viewer; thus, certain interpretations may be favored at certain times while others are constrained, forbidden, transgressive, or even impossible.
Let&rsquo;s look at our example text at closer range. The Dark Knight emerged in the post-9/11 era as the US and its allies arrayed themselves against a perceived existential threat from a shadowy international terrorist organization. This period of history is often described as the War on Terror. The years immediately before the film&rsquo;s release were some of the bloodiest in terms of casualties in the Iraq theater and there were explosive revelations about the Bush administration&rsquo;s use of secret executive orders to conduct warrantless electronic surveillance of American citizens. We see evidence of this in the film as Bruce Wayne constructs a giant computer that essentially hacks every cellphone in Gotham to try and catch the Joker, a nihilistic terrorist bent on destroying the city. Lucius Fox and Batman&rsquo;s conversation1 about the electronic eavesdropping is symptomatic of the broader cultural conversation:
We can see that the film explores the temptation to throw out essential liberties or exceed legal limits in the face of a terrorist threat. Specifically, Dark Knight explores the ethics of nullifying a fundamental right to privacy in order to prevent future terrorist acts and loss of life&mdash;mirroring the actions of the Bush administration in secretly tasking various US security organizations with monitoring the communications of all Americans to root out possible terrorist plots. We might push this reading further by examining how the other aspects of the film wrestle with the ethics of torture2 and extraordinary rendition in the context of counterterrorism, also preoccupations of the Bush administration at the time.
While this is not yet a complete reading of the film, we have identified an aspect of this cultural artifact that relates to its historical context. From here we might ask whether the film works as an apologia for the Bush administration&rsquo;s actions during this period or whether it mounts a critique or articulates a warning about such actions. We may have opposing views on the matter as readers due to a number of complex factors that help struture our views. In any case, I hope this gives you some sense of the thinking that leads to analysis and argument in a cultural studies project.
Lucius Fox knows that Batman is Bruce Wayne. So why does Batman keep disguising his voice with the absurd growl? I need to know this.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
The prison interrogation scene of the Joker seems relevant here.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;
`}),e.add({id:44,href:"/courses/workshops/introductions/",title:"On Introductions",content:` WR3 | Workshops On Introductions Writing a good introduction is like asking someone out on a date. You’ve got to make a good first impression, it’s helpful if you look good, and if the other person just can’t see where this is going, you’re probably going to get turned down cold. In short, introduction is seduction.
Many of the introductions I’ve read, while competent and informative, are not very seductive. They have a thesis and provide context, but they don’t draw the reader in or make her want to read more. Think about your audience: will they want to continue reading your essay after completing your introduction? If not, how can you make your introduction more alluring, captivating, perhaps even shocking? Since you are writing essays on apocalyptic themes, this should not be too difficult.
One thing you might experiment with is creating an evocative or arresting image. Alternatively, you might tell a brief story or present a striking fact or statistic that will cause the reader concern or anxiety. You might ask the reader to imagine something—a possible future that waits for us if we fail to do X, Y, or Z, for example. If you write an introduction correctly, your readers will have no choice but to continue reading.
Allow me to illustrate with two ways of beginning the same essay:
Opioid deaths 1 Deaths from opioid overdose have reached a five-year high in the state of New Hampshire and are a leading cause of death in the United States. vs
Opioid deaths 2 Pema clutched her stuffed animal while her mother OD&rsquo;d on the cold hotel bathroom floor. OR
Apocalyptic films 1 Lately, American cinema has focused on disaster, destruction, and apocalypse—a fact that is suggestive of a widespread anxiety about the relative safety of the nation. vs
Apocalyptic films 2 In the false twilight of smoke and choking ash, ghostlike figures warm themselves by a pale fire kindled amid the rubble and twisted rebar. As a reader, how do you respond to these rhetorical choices? Is one more effective than the other?
Today&rsquo;s Workshop In today’s workshop I would like you to exchange essays with another student and read each other’s introductions. Brainstorm together on how the introductions might be creatively rewritten in the spirit of the examples above. After a brief discussion, rewrite your introduction. This is just an experiment. Try some things out. Play with your intro. Be bold. You may discover an exciting new way to begin your essay. Of course, you are not required to keep the new introduction if you don’t believe that it makes your paper more successful. This is your essay. But who knows, you may hit on something.
`}),e.add({id:45,href:"/courses/workshops/sentence-variety/",title:"On Sentence Variety",content:` WR3 | Workshops Sentence Variety Integrating quotations from other sources is an important part of academic writing. Student writers are often able to write sentences well in their own voice but have difficulty when they try to weave the voices of others into their prose. I also find that most students have developed a particular strategy or formula for quotation that they use over and over again as a kind of crutch. This structure resembles the following:
According to Dr. Taylor, “all your quotes are made the same way” (89).
This sentence is correct in every way; however, it is important to develop some flexibility with respect to quotations. If you rely on a single strategy for quotation, your writing will be repetitive and bland. Further, you will often discover that the words you would like to quote will not easily fit into the structure illustrated above. Attempting to cram this borrowed language into your trusted, familiar structure will result in awkward and ungrammatical sentences. If you develop an ability to form sentences with a variety of structures, you will never have this problem.
My guess is that most of you rely on this structure because you assume that the words of others must be presented in the precise order that they appear in the original text. Part of becoming a better writer is understanding that you have the authority to chop up, reorder, and alter quotations to serve your purposes so long as you do not misrepresent the thinking or arguments of others.
A few examples Let’s examine few examples based on this passage from George Orwell’s famous essay entitled “A Hanging”:
It was about forty yards to the gallows. I watched the bare brown back of the prisoner marching in front of me. He walked clumsily with his bound arms, but quite steadily, with that bobbing gait of the Indian who never straightens his knees. At each step his muscles slid neatly into place, the lock of hair on his scalp danced up and down, his feet printed themselves on the wet gravel. And once, in spite of the men who gripped him by each shoulder, he stepped slightly aside to avoid a puddle on the path. It is curious, but till that moment I had never realized what it means to destroy a healthy, conscious man. When I saw the prisoner step aside to avoid the puddle, I sawt he mystery, the unspeakable wrongness, of cutting a life short when it is in full tide. This man was not dying, he was alive just as we were alive. All the organs of his body were working&mdash;bowels digesting food, skin renewing itself, nails growing, tissues forming—all toiling away in solemn foolery. His nails would still be growing when he stood on the drop, when he was falling through the air with a tenth of a second to live. His eyes saw the yellow gravel and the grey walls, and his brain still remembered, foresaw, reasoned&mdash;reasoned even about puddles. He and we were a party of men walking together, seeing, hearing, feeling, understanding the same world; and in two minutes, with a sudden snap, one of us would be gone&mdash;one mind less, one world less. (47)
The following sentences all express the same meaning; however, they use a variety of sentence structures to accomplish that goal:
“It is curious,” Orwell relates, as the hanging party approaches the gallows and the prisoner tries to avoid stepping in a puddle, “but till that moment I had never realized what it means to destroy a healthy, conscious man” (47).
Orwell finds it “curious” that it was only after viewing a condemned prisoner avoid getting wet on the way to his death that he “realized what it means to destroy a healthy, conscious man” (47).
Orwell reveals a “curious” truth: he “never realized what it means to destroy a healthy, conscious man” until he watched a condemned prisoner “[step] slightly aside to avoid a puddle” on the way to the gallows (47).
By moving “slightly aside to avoid a puddle,” a condemned man makes George Orwell suddenly realize a most “curious” truth: “what it means to destroy a healthy, conscious man” (47).
As the condemned man approaches the gallows and steps slightly aside to avoid a puddle, Orwell observes: “It is curious, but till that moment I had never realized what it means to destroy a healthy, conscious man” (47).
Workshop Exercise This second passage is taken from Richard Hofstadter’s famous essay entitled “The Paranoid Style in American Politics,” which was published in Harper’s Magazine in 1964. In the essay, Hofstadter analyzes the over-blown rhetoric and paranoid psychology of a certain political type:
The paranoid spokesman sees the fate of conspiracy in apocalyptic terms—he traffics in the birth and death of whole worlds, whole political orders, whole systems of human values. He is always manning the barricades of civilization. He constantly lives at a turning point. Like religious millennialists he expresses the anxiety of those who are living through the last days and he is sometimes disposed to set a date for the apocalypse. (77)
In the example sentence below, I have summarized the meaning of the passage. Rewrite this same meaning seven additional times using a new sentence structure and a quotation from the Hofstadter passage. It might be helpful to use some of my example sentences above for inspiration.
Hofstadtler argues that the paranoid politician and the religious fundamentalist both have rhetorical excess and exaggeration in common (77). `}),e.add({id:46,href:"/resources/project-grain-elevator/",title:"Project Grain Elevator",content:` What is Project Grain Elevator? &ldquo;In most cases, the term &lsquo;grain elevator&rsquo; also describes the entire elevator complex, including receiving and testing offices, weighbridges, and storage facilities.

On rare occasions, some grand historical event rudely intervenes and makes the standard procedures obsolete or problematic in some way. Project Grain Elevator is of the latter category: this particular revision was inspired by the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) and easily accessible Generative AI (GAI) tools that appeared in late 2022.
The Purpose of Education “At a fundamental level, the development of AI requires us to consider the purpose of education.”
– Corinne Hyde
“Mechanical devices that separate the act of writing from the hand of the writer have provoked fascination and dismay since the early days of the Industrial Revolution. Machines that resembled humans and appeared to write on their own delighted the royal courts of Europe in the late eighteenth century. Like music boxes or cuckoo clocks, these automata executed preprogrammed tasks. But they proved to be particularly captivating because the task they performed—handwriting—was thought to be uniquely human. An automata’s ability to hold a pen, ink it, and write phrases in cursive demonstrated its inventor’s mechanical ingenuity. At the same time, by mutely mimicking a process associated with self-reflection and individuality, automata made for absurd parodies of Enlightenment values.”
— “Writing Machines,” Ghosts in the Machine (162)
Writing in the Age of Mechanical Production Before we consider using any new tool or technology, we should ask ourselves whether it contributes to the overall purpose of education. While Generative AI certainly has a place in many fields and disciplines in varying degrees (and I&rsquo;m genuinely excited about many aspects of it myself), I believe that it is fundamentally in conflict with the goals of the writing classroom. My sense has always been that the writing classroom is the best place to develop a host of important skills, including the development of critical thinking, metacritical analysis (thinking about our thinking), information literacy, creativity, communication skills, and various research competencies/instincts. Mostly my interest so far is trying to think though how overreliance on GAI will affect critical thinking and a number of central skills and competencies that I associate with education and general intelligence. These new technologies are designed to give answers, not encourage us to develop understanding or skill. All of this poking around (which I&rsquo;ve only just started) is directed toward the possible disruption that AI presents in the developing of such important abilities.
After reading Paulo Freire’s work on the “banking concept” of education, I’ve really become sensitized to the idea that certain common approaches to learning and teaching carry adverse lessons that are never thematized, are largely invisible, but are nevertheless extremely harmful. We can learn the capitals of various countries by rote memorization at the direction of a teacher, or we can inquire on our own by exploring a map for ourselves or together with others. While the end result may be quite similar (we know the capitals), the students who have been “banked” have also internalized another lesson: that they are not sovereign, that truth is what authorities say it is, that learning is a relationship of dependence. I wonder how the widespread use of AI might also shape us? Certainly, it will further intensify the belief that education is just a series of transactions. I am struck by Cao and Dede’s thoughts on this point:
“An education that is heavily focused on products reduces learning to a transaction, exchanging a product for a grade, rather than providing a transformative human experience. Learning is much more than generating a product; in fact, the essence of learning is in the process – the journey rather than the destination.

I&rsquo;m also interested in the phenomenon we&rsquo;ve all experienced where the writing itself brings out the ideas that we did not know we possessed. The writing conjures these thoughts, often revealing surprising beliefs or ideas that we did not know we held before. Like E.M Forster&rsquo;s famous quip: &ldquo;How can I know what I think until I see what I say?&rdquo; These common experiences point to there being something special about writing as a tool for discovery—a way of making sense of the world, our values, and commitments. This seems something that could very well be deeply compromised if we develop a reliance on GAI. David Galbraith has worked on this idea for a while now. In his “Raiding the Inarticulate” he says that “The content that we write about is not pre-stored, waiting only on us to decide how best to deploy it, but is instead something that is constituted as we write. And the process of constituting this content is not straightforward but is instead a matter of trying to capture our understanding as it unfolds in the text. Writing, to use T. S. Eliot’s phrase, is a raid on the inarticulate, and it is integrating this process with the more strategic aspects of writing that is the work of writing.” (Galbraith, &ldquo;Raiding,&rdquo; 238).
I’ve also been poking about at earlier Writing Studies scholarship in the 80s and 90s, when the “Write to Learn” movement was making strides. A lot of the research in the folders concerns some of this early work which intersected with early cognitive science and psychology. I think the WTL movement may be traced back to Anne Gere’s Roots in the Sawdust (1985), where she argues: &ldquo;Writing is uniquely suited to foster abstract thought. As cognitive psychologists and composition theorists have noted, writing is an extremely focused activity which simultaneously involves hand, eye, and brain. The linearity of writing, one word after the other, leads to more coherent and sustained thought than thinking or speaking. The physical limitations imposed on writers make writing a slow process (slow relative to thinking or talking), and this slowness seems to free some parts of the brain for the discoveries so common among writers&rdquo; (qtd. in Ackerman 349).
&ldquo;At a fundamental level, the development of AI requires us to consider the purpose of education.”
— Corinne Hyde, professor of clinical education
Before we consider using any new tool or technology, we should ask ourselves whether it contributes to the overall purpose of our education. While Generative AI (GAI) certainly has a place in many fields and disciplines in varying degrees, I believe that it is fundamentally in conflict with the goals of the writing classroom. These goals include the development of critical thinking, metacritical analysis (thinking about our thinking), information literacy, and research skills. These new technologies are designed to give answers, not encourage us to develop understanding or skill.
One benefit from the advent of these AI tools, however, is that it allows us to stop and consider, perhaps for the first time, the actual purpose of education and, in particular, of learning to write. Of what use is writing for ourselves? Of what use is learning to write? If the essay that you turn in is just a product that you need to submit in order to get a reward, then using GAI to complete the assignment makes perfect sense. This is a symptom of a larger pattern of thought that imagines the whole of education as a series of transactions, the delivery of products in exchange for a grade or promotion. You can certainly do that. Many do. However, as As Lydia Cao and Chris Dede write,
An education that is heavily focused on products reduces learning to a transaction, exchanging a product for a grade, rather than providing a transformative human experience. Learning is much more than generating a product; in fact, the essence of learning is in the process – the journey rather than the destination. Learning to write is not primarily about producing a well-structured piece of text but about developing the capacity to organize one’s ideas, connect these to others’ ideas, analyze claims, synthesize insights, and fulfill our fundamental need to communicate with and learn from others. (3)
What is the purpose of education and learning? Learning to write, and writing to learn, are perhaps the best way to accomplish several central goals of education. These goals include the development of critical thinking, metacritical analysis (thinking about our thinking), information literacy, creativity, instincts, communication skills, and research competencies. These new technologies are designed to give answers, not encourage us to develop understanding or skill—things that are likely to become even more valuable in the future. Please know that these are not the ravings of some grumpy, out-of-touch old man. I have reasons.

Until quite recently, when we imagined the technolgical future, we conjured images of androids that resemble the Boston Dynamic creatures out in fields; clutching spades, powered by sunlight, the robots meticulously tending to potatoes and melons and corn; carefully eliminating pests by hand so that no pesticides will ever enter the food system, and plucking the food at the perfect moment of ripeness, placing it in mechanized bins that cart the goods to a factory, also manned by robots who wash and prepare and can our food. Thereafter shipped to distribution centers where our personal robots will go do our shopping for us. At home, our personal domestic robots will charge themselves in our basements each night, and when detecting our wakening, will spring to life and cook us eggs and the busy itself cleaning our houses and weeding our yards. It was, in short, a vision of life freed of all unwanted physical labor and drudgery: the cleaning of bathtubs and toilets, shopping for food, preparing meals, mowing lawns. With technology, we could finally inherit the world John Maynard Keynes famously imagined in 1930 in &ldquo;Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren,&rdquo; where effiencies in production and compoud interest carried from the past would relieve humans from almost all need to labor. Without this burden we could maximize our precious time here on earth by living lives of leisure: discovering our potential, exploring our humanity, travelling, thinking, creating art, conteplating beauty. But the new world that appears to be dawning here is the inversion of that dream. Our robot surrogates obviate thinking and humanizing efforts so that we can find a better place in the system of labor that exploits us. We seem instead intent on creating a world free of mental effort and creation: the slow work of close reading and analysis, creation, inspiration and communication.
In many ways this is beneficial to students because it requires a shift away from a product-based, transactional model of education, to a process-based form of education rooted in inquiry and intrinsic motivation. As Lydia Cao and Chris Dede write,
An education that is heavily focused on products reduces learning to a transaction, exchanging a product for a grade, rather than providing a transformative human experience. Learning is much more than generating a product; in fact, the essence of learning is in the process – the journey rather than the destination.

Similarly, learning a new language is much more than being able to speak in that tongue; bilingualism is about learning another style of thinking, taking on a different cultural identity, and embodying an alternative way of being and living in the world.

How But this does take some doing if you were invested in deliverable objects like an end-of-term final essay for student assessment.
Although I don&rsquo;t lose any sleep at night worrying about sentient robots enslaving mankind, there is a much more subtle threat that has begun to loom large in my imagination and take up a great deal of my thought life. I think it has a much more realistic chance of ending humanity as we know it. And it is perhaps all the more terrifying because it will be a form of what Rob Nixon calls &ldquo;slow violence&rdquo;: a form of violence &ldquo;that occurs gradually and out of sight, a violence of delayed destruction that is dispersed across time and space, an attritional violence that is typically not viewed as violence at all&rdquo; (2). Since our media environments are biased toward sensational spectacles of destruction, and humans tend to hysterically inflate things they fear, cultural anxieties about new technologies have frequently been articulated as exaggerated, dramatic ends to humanity. But to my mind, the threat from AI is unlikely to take the form of an apocalypse; I think it will more likely result in the slow, insensible erosion of the characteristics and abilities that we&rsquo;ve traditionaly thought of as defining the human.
Remove anxieties about grading, which may lead students to lose trust in themselves and their own abilities. &ldquo;No one plagiarizes their diary entries.&rdquo; Emphasize writing and thinking assignments that generate intrinsic motivation, rather than use extrinsic ones. Eliminate any elements that suggest education-as-product rather than education-as-process: the journey, not the destination. Prosthetic Gods Long ago [man] formed an ideal conception of omnipotence and omniscience which he embodied in his gods. To these gods he attributed everything that seemed unattainable to his wishes, or that was forbidden to him. One may say, therefore, that these gods were cultural ideals. Today he has come very close to the attainment of this ideal, he has almost become a god himself. Only, it is true, in the fashion in which ideals are usually attained according to the general judgment of humanity: not completely, in some respects not at all, in others only half way. Man has, as it were, become a kind of prosthetic God. When he puts on all his auxiliary organs he is truly magnificent; but those organs have not grown on to him and they still give him much trouble at times. . . . Future ages will bring with them new and probably unimaginably great advances in this field of civilization and will increase man’s likeness to God still more. But in the interests of our investigations, we will not forget that present-day man does not feel happy in his Godlike character.
— Freud, Civilization and Its Discontents
Technology shapes us, often as much as we shape it. As Freud remarks, our technological devices augment us with almost superhuman powers: a telephone amplfies our voice so that I can be heard thousands of miles away; a telescope gives us a view into the deepest corner of the universe. As we merge with technology Before we consider using any new tool or technology that is designed to augment or improve our lives, we should pause and reflect on how this tool might alter us.
Certainly, we&rsquo;ve all sweated out a final paper, trying to change our fonts or fiddle with margins so that we can make the required page count. Or we&rsquo;ve been paralyzed by writer&rsquo;s block as we tried to come up with an idea for an essay. Or we struggled with finding quality sources for a research project. It doesn&rsquo;t feel like it at the time, but the entire point of this sort of work is to struggle, and fail, and try again. That&rsquo;s where the learning happens; that&rsquo;s where skills are forged.
What is the point of these assignments? The purpose that we&rsquo;ve all forgotten because we imagine these things as hoops that we must jump through, or tasks that we must complete so that we can be give our reward of a grade and move on to the next task. This is an understanding of school, education, assignments, as a series of transactions. But why are we doing these assignments in the first place? Just to make kids dance a dance for us, like a bunch of authoritarian weirdos before passing them along to another one of our tribe? Writing in the Age of Artifical Reproduction Mechanical devices that separate the act of writing from the hand of the writer have provoked fascination and dismay since the early days of the Industrial Revolution. Machines that resem- bled humans and appeared to write on their own delighted the royal courts of Europe in the late eighteenth century. Like music boxes or cuckoo clocks, these automata executed prepro- grammed tasks. But they proved to be particularly captivating because the task they performed—handwriting—was thought to be uniquely human. An automata’s ability to hold a pen, ink it, and write phrases in cursive demonstrated its inventor’s mechanical ingenuity. At the same time, by mutely mimicking a process associated with self-reflection and individuality, automata made for absurd parodies of Enlightenment values.

`}),e.add({id:47,href:"/courses/workshops/search-with-precision/",title:"Searching with Precision",content:` WR3 | Workshops Searching with Precision This workshop is designed to help you perform keyword searches of library catalogs and electronic databases with efficiency. While most students have some familiarity with keyword searching through the Google search engine, library catalogs and databases don&rsquo;t work in the same way. To query databases effectively and efficiently, you need to be familiar with Boolean searches.
Keyword searches often produce too many results to examine in a reasonable amount of time. Keyword searches also suffer from large volumes of irrelevant results. Rather than page through hundreds or thousands of search results or sift through unwanted ones, you can perform what are known as Boolean searches to make your queries much more precise. Boolean searches use what are known as logical operators to form search strings that help you zero in on the content you seek.
The three most common logical operators are AND, OR, and NOT. However, you should also learn how to use exact phrases, truncation, and wildcards in search strings.
Workshop Study the following information, then complete the problem sets.
Operator Purpose Example AND Narrow a search by adding additional keywords Tom Hardy AND shirtless OR Broaden a search by adding additional keywords Ohio OR Virginia NOT Prune search results by removing certain keywords Vikings NOT football &quot;...&quot; Return results containing an exact phrase &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; * Truncation: used to capture all the word endings from a search term manufact* ? Wildcard: Finds spelling variations organi?ation, wom?n Boolean search examples These Boolean terms are described in more detail below:
AND Although it may seem counterintuitive, AND is used to narrow the number of sources you retrieve from a database. You can visualize the search of a large academic database or library catalog using the following diagram:
{ linguistics AND cognitive AND childhood }
In the search depicted above, a student has requested articles that contain the subjects cognitive, linguistics, and childhood. This particular search will only retrieve articles that contain all three terms. This small subset of the larger subject sets is referenced by the arrow. All the information represented by the other portions of the three circles will be excluded. Thus, even if an article contains two of the three search terms, it will be excluded from the results.
OR Unlike the AND operator, OR seeks to broaden a search, as in this example:
{ Virginia OR Ohio }
In the search depicted above, a student has searched for the subjects Virginia OR Ohio. This search will return every article having the subject of Virginia as well as every article with the subject of Ohio. Unlike the AND search, where only articles containing both terms are returned in the search results, the OR search yields every source on both subjects regardless of whether those subjects appear together in the same source. As a consequence, the OR search will produce far more results.
Since the OR operator lacks precision, it is most often used in parenthetical searches, described below. NOT The Boolean operator NOT is used to subtract or screen out topics or keywords that are unwanted within the search results.
{ &ldquo;alternative energy&rdquo; NOT solar }
In the search depicted above, a student is researching alternative energy and wants to exclude any information dealing with solar energy. To remove all references to solar energy, the student has searched for &ldquo;alternative energy,&rdquo; but has removed any articles from the search results that contain the subject solar using the operator NOT.
The NOT operator is helpful when you find your search results are polluted with unwanted items. This is often a problem when two distinct things share the same name. For example, if you were researching the Norse explorers known as the Vikings, you might discover that your search results include unwanted information about the Minnesota Vikings football team. You can subtract these unwanted results by searching for Vikings NOT Minnesota or Vikings NOT football, for example.
This search uses quotation marks to form an exact phrase search, described below. Advanced searching These Boolean operators can be used to create long, increasingly precise search strings when they are fortified with more advanced operators: parentheticals, exact phrases, and wildcards.
Parenthetical searches You can also use the various Boolean search terms in tandem using parenthetical constructions:
(Ohio OR Virginia) AND unemployment
(cognitive AND linguistics) NOT childhood
Such parenthetical searches follow the order of operations, like in math equations. In the first example, the search will first combine all the articles with the keyword of Ohio to all the articles with the keyword Virginia, creating a large collection of search results. Afterward, the keyword unemployment will be applied to that collection using the AND operator, yielding the final search results that look for sources dealing with unemployment in either Virginia and Ohio. Similarly, the second example creates a large collection of results that share the subjects cognitive and linguistics, then all the items having the term childhood are removed from the results.
Exact phrase searches Most Internet search engines and library catalogs default to the AND operator when multiple terms are entered, even if it has not been typed by the user. For example, if you search for artificial intelligence, the search algorithm will actually use the search string artificial AND intelligence to produce your results. In some circumstances this may produce undesirable results. For example, we might imagine an article about the &ldquo;intelligence&rdquo; of using certain &ldquo;artificial&rdquo; sweeteners in food for children. This is not an article that is relevant for your project.
To avoid this problem, you can instruct your search engine to perform what is known as an exact phrase search. This is performed by placing quotation marks around the exact words you are searching for:
&ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; AND apocalypse By searching for &ldquo;artificial intelligence&rdquo; your search results will only contain items that have that exact phrase within the document or title.
Truncation and wildcards manufact* (truncation)
wom?n (wild card)
If you search for the terms steel AND manufacturing, your search results may not include results with the terms manufacturer, manufacture, manufactured, or manufactures. As a result, you may not discover articles or books that are important to your research. By truncating the word with an asterisk, however, you will gather all the relevant search results.
Similarly, if you only search for woman, you will potentially miss out on the all the texts that mention women or womyn. Or imagine that you are doing research on a certain type of organization. It would be wise to search for organi?ation, since much of the English-speaking world spells the word with an &ldquo;s&rdquo; instead of a &ldquo;z&rdquo; as we do here in the US. Without this, your research may become skewed to favor the literature on US-based institutions. However, using the wild card ? you will search all spellings simultaneously, gathering all the relevant results. The question mark wild card should be used to replace a single letter only.
To illustrate, look at these two searches on the JSTOR database:
Iraq AND manufacturing (14,863 results)
Iraq AND manufact* (30,868 results) 👀️
Problem Set You want to examine fictional portrayals of Arab-Israeli conflict. Create a Boolean search string to search the library catalog with.
Narrow the previous search by examining only fictional portrayals involving Israelis and Palestinians available in our library.
Answer This research question seems to arise from someone who would like to get a general look at the universe of texts that have a particular thematic focus. We are not looking for a particular book; we want to find all of the works of fiction that deal with this historical conflict. This gets me thinking about using controlled vocabulary terms provided by subject headings.
However, I didn&rsquo;t know what the proper subject headings were, so I started off with keyword searches using terms like these below, trying to capture some sources that I could use to isolate some subject headings:
Israel* AND Arab AND Fiction
Israel* AND Palestin* AND Fiction
Israel* AND Arab AND Motion Pictures
These keyword searches led to many good hits from which I extracted the following subject headings:
Jewish-Arab relations Fiction Motion Pictures Palestinian Arabs Arab-Israeli conflict Arab-Israeli conflict -- Literature and the conflict Then I performed some subject searches like these:
1. Arab-Israeli conflict AND Fiction 2. Arab-Israeli conflict AND Fiction AND Palestinian Arabs These subject searches in the catalog allowed me to find all the books that we have on these subjects. This type of searching is very useful for getting the 20,000-foot view of a topic. At some point, however, you must narrow your focus. So you will likely have to do some additional searches once your interests become more precise.
And since these subject searches are only going to return books (and some physical media), you should also think about proper keyword searches for academic databases which you must search separately. Since these searches are about fiction, we should find databases that specialize in fiction: the MLA database, for example.
Find peer-reviewed sources that examine Herman Melville&rsquo;s novel Moby Dick and the Cold War that were written between 1990 and 2000. Answer Here I used two exact phrase searches in a keyword search and then used the library&rsquo;s search delimiters to narrow the search for peer-reviewed publications between 1990 and 2000.
&quot;Moby Dick&quot; AND &quot;Cold War&quot; You are curious if there is any scholarship on fictional portrayals of pandemic disease. Answer This problem is also one that we should tackle though the use of controlled vocabulary terms. First I began with some general keywords that I associated with this idea: pandemic AND fiction. After finding a few relevant hits I was able to discover subject headings that allowed me to dive deeply into what is available on the subject. Significantly, I learned that the controlled vocabulary term I should probably use is &ldquo;epidemic&rdquo; and not &ldquo;pandemic&rdquo; as I had first thought:
Plague in literature Fiction -- History and criticism Fiction Epidemics in literature Diseases and literature Criticism, interpretation, etc You want to know if certain governments are using the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to spy on their citizens. Answer This problem is more challenging for several reasons: 1) the current pandemic is a very recent event, which means peer-reviewed sources are less numerous than many other topics; 2) the keyword &ldquo;spy&rdquo; is not very productive since the controlled vocabulary term preferred by libraries is &ldquo;surveillance&rdquo;; and 3) the word &ldquo;surveillance&rdquo; is also term of art that is used to describe the legitimate efforts by epidemiologists and government health organizations to understand the spread of disease, thus polluting our results with sources that we don&rsquo;t actually want.
To overcome these issues we may have to come at this by relying on journalism outlets we respect and any government publications or open-source intelligence we can find. And we may need to add additional keywords such as rights, privacy, libert*, or freedom* to try and find sources that favor our intentions with the keyword surveillance.
I started with a Google search using the following search string, which produced several good leads:
government* AND covid* AND surveillance AND privacy A number of these results cite other related texts in their bibliographies, so a citation chase will be helpful to locate other sources.
We might further augment this search string by using the names of particular countries and/or intelligence services of interest.
I reproduced this search string in our library and found several peer-reviewed articles:
government* AND covid* AND surveillance AND privacy You are interested in female MMA fighters and want to know if there is any scholarship on this. Answer This search gave us an opportunity to use a wildcard. By using &ldquo;Wom?n&rdquo; we can ensure that we get sources that reference both &ldquo;women&rdquo; and &ldquo;woman&rdquo;. And the exact phrase search helps us find articles that only mention the words &ldquo;mixed martial arts&rdquo; in that exact order.
Wom?n AND &ldquo;mixed martial arts&rdquo; Wom?n AND &ldquo;mixed martial arts&rdquo; AND gender `}),e.add({id:48,href:"/courses/workshops/show-not-tell/",title:"Showing, not Telling",content:` WR3 | Workshops Show, Don&rsquo;t Tell In writing that involves outside sources it is often more powerful to show rather than tell. But what does that mean?
While it is an important and necessary skill to summarize or paraphrase the words of other writers using our own words, relying exclusively on this strategy may give your readers reasons to doubt your presentation of the facts. You are, in essence, telling your readers: &ldquo;Just trust me, this is accurate.&rdquo; We can call this approach telling.
Another approach is to offer your readers some proof at decisive moments by presenting the actual words of your source in the form of a quotation. The quotations don&rsquo;t have to be very long or involved; but when they exist, the reader will feel that your claims are more trustworthy. The reader doesn&rsquo;t have to merely trust you; now you&rsquo;ve provided some evidence. We can call this approach showing.
An overreliance on telling, even when duly cited, may weaken your rhetorical authority. In this workshop we will practice turning a telling sentence into a showing one.
Example Let&rsquo;s examine two approaches to representing a key passage from a course reading:
Source Text &mdash; From Paulo Freire, &ldquo;The &lsquo;Banking&rsquo; Concept of Education,&rdquo; p. 72.
For apart from inquiry, apart from the praxis, individuals cannot be truly human. Knowledge emerges only through invention and reinvention, through the restless, impatient, continuing, hopeful inquiry human beings pursue in the world, with the world, and with each other.
Compare the following sentences: Telling: Freire emphasizes that our ability to inquire is what makes us human, so taking away this part of us is taking away our humanity (72). Showing: Freire maintains that our ability to ask questions and perform research are bedrock features of our humanity: &ldquo;For apart from inquiry,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;individuals cannot be truly human&rdquo; (72).
Showing: Freire insists that it is only through the &ldquo;restless, impatient, continuing, hopeful inquiry&rdquo; that we &ldquo;pursue in the world, with the world, and with each other&rdquo; that we can be &ldquo;truly human&rdquo; (72).
To Review: Please understand: there is absolutely nothing wrong with the telling sentence above; in fact, your writing will be full of such sentences that accurately present another author&rsquo;s ideas in your own words. However, relying on this strategy exclusively (or even just habitually) may have a negative effect on your readers&rsquo; sense of how trustworthy you seem.
Again, summary and paraphrase are critical skills; however, when you state that another author says X or means Y, it makes your claim much stronger if you frequently (but judiciously) use the actual words or terms the author chooses. Now your reader doesn&rsquo;t just have to &ldquo;trust&rdquo; you, they can see for themselves.
Workshop Directions: Rewrite the following three telling sentences to make two separate showing ones. Your second sentence should use a completely new sentence structure, as in the example above.
Passage 1 &mdash; From Paulo Freire, &ldquo;The &lsquo;Banking&rsquo; Concept of Education,&rdquo; p. 72.
Education thus becomes an act of depositing, in which the students are the depositories and the teacher is the depositor. Instead of communicating, the teacher issues communiqués and makes deposits which the students patiently receive, memorize, and repeat. This is the &ldquo;banking&rdquo; concept of education, in which the scope of action allowed to the students extends only as far as receiving, filing, and storing the deposits.
Telling: Freire uses the metaphor of a bank to describe the relationship between teacher and student. The teacher deposits facts and information into the student like someone depositing money at a bank. The students are not allowed an active role; instead they just memorize the ideas and facts presented by their teachers (72). Showing 1: Freire criticizes a model of education that he likens to banking, where &ldquo;the students are the depositories and the teacher is the depositor&rdquo; (72). Instead of dialogue and true communication, &ldquo;the teacher issues communiqués and makes deposits which the students patiently receive, memorize, and repeat.&rdquo;
Showing 2: Freire described what he calls the &ldquo;&lsquo;banking&rsquo; concept of education,&rdquo; where students are treated as &ldquo;depositories&rdquo; and are only permitted the actions of &ldquo;receiving, filing, and storing the deposits&rdquo; made by teachers.
Passage 2 &mdash; From Walker Percy, &ldquo;The Loss of the Creature,&rdquo; p. 47.
Seeing the canyon under approved circumstances is seeing the symbolic complex head on. The thing is no longer the thing as it confronted the Spaniard; it is rather that which has already been formulated—by picture postcard, geography book, tourist folders, and the words Grand Canyon. As a result of this preformulation, the source of the sightseer’s pleasure undergoes a shift. Where the wonder and delight of the Spaniard arose from his penetration of the thing itself, from a progressive discovery of depths, patterns, colors, shadows, etc., now the sightseer measures his satisfaction by the degree to which the canyon conforms to the preformed complex.
Telling: Walker Percy argues that it is now extraordinarily difficult to see the Grand Canyon in an original way because of our prior exposure to images and descriptions of the place (47). Showing 1: Percy argues that we no longer see the Grand Canyon authentically and without influence as its original discoverer could; instead, we must view the place through &ldquo;approved circumstances,&rdquo; through a complex lens comprised of all the images, descriptions, and representations of the place that we have been exposed to in our lifetimes (72).
Showing 2: For Percy, viewing the canyon as its original discoverer did is now virtually impossible since our view is now conditioned by what he calls &ldquo;preformulation,&rdquo; an exposure to symbolic representations such as a &ldquo;picture postcard, geography book, tourist folders, and the words Grand Canyon&rdquo; (47).
Passage 3 &mdash; From Nicholson Baker, &ldquo;Changes of Mind,&rdquo; p. 7.
We must not overlook sudden conversions and wrenching insights, but usually we fasten on to these only in hindsight, and exaggerate them for the sake of narrative&mdash;a tool perfected by the great nineteenth-century novelists, who sit their heroines down and have them deduce the intolerability of their situation in one unhappy night, as the fire burns itself into embers in the grate.
Telling: Baker warns us that the detection of a change of mind often sends us on an investigation into the past, where we make up false narratives to help explain why our opinions change (7). Showing 1: Baker argues that while we can&rsquo;t completely discount &ldquo;sudden conversions and wrenching insights,&rdquo; for the most part we manufacture false narratives of this sort to explain how a change of mind occurred (7).
Showing 2: While Baker allows that we may sometimes experience a &ldquo;sudden conversion&rdquo; that changes our minds, most often we &ldquo;we fasten on to these only in hindsight, and exaggerate them for the sake of narrative,&rdquo; giving us a false sense of control or comprehension (7).

Is the paper organized? Is there a logical flow to the essay? Or are there abrupt shifts in ideas or topics that are confusing or hard to follow? Do the paragraphs seem to transition into each other well? Or are there sudden “leaps” between them?
Do you have questions? Is there something that you’d like to ask about why the author chose to write something in the way that he or she did? Are there any ambiguities that you need resolved before you can properly understand something in the paper?
What about the formal properties of the essay? Does the essay use MLA format incorrectly? Discuss what you think the error might be in your group. Use the handbook to find consensus.
What’s the big take-away? What is the single biggest thing that the author should concentrate on in his or her revision?
`}),e.add({id:50,href:"/courses/workshops/theoretical-argument/",title:"Theoretical Argument",content:` WR2 | Workshops Theoretical Argument Source Text Student Paragraph Rushmore the school tries to keep Max under control, but Max resists it. Max has terrible grades, even in Theater II, a class which you would think he would excel at. But why is Max failing all of his classes when he is clearly very intelligent? It is clear that Max is far more interested in his many extracurricular activities than in the traditional classroom lessons. Max is clearly learning and creating and challenging himself; he just refuses to take part in the formal education in the classroom. Thus, we can see that Max has rejected what Freire calls the “banking method” of education. Rather than merely memorize what some authority tells him, Max instead prefers to be his own authority and direct his own learning, something Freire calls “inquiry.” Max’s varied interests—from beekeeping to playwriting—are things that Max does instead of the memorization that is required for “success” in the banking system at Rushmore.
Workshop Rewrite the paragraph above using the advice below:
Topic sentences (for the most part) should 1) make a claim, 2) introduce a theoretical concept from Freire, and 3) connect it to the film in some way, moving the argument or analysis forward.
Make use of the theory in the paragraph body: bring in Freire’s words, concepts, arguments to help perform the analysis. Remember to show, not merely tell. Use page 72 from Freire&rsquo;s essay to find language for the revision to this paragraph.
`}),e.add({id:51,href:"/courses/workshops/peer-reviews/",title:"What is Peer Review?",content:` WR3 | Workshops Peer review Peer review is a form of quality control in academic publishing. Before books or articles are published, they experience a rigorous process of evaluation by at least three experts who have advanced training in the field of study in question. These &ldquo;referees,&rdquo; as they are known, review the work anonymously. This anonymity theoretically ensures a more honest appraisal of the work under consideration for publication. When it works as intended, this scholarly review helps eliminate factual errors and other problems before the works are published. Thus, peer-reviewed works are more trustworthy than other sources of information.
Determining if a source is peer-reviewed For novice researchers, distinguishing peer-reviewed sources from other published information can be challenging. Perhaps the best advice is to use only sources that you located within the library system, rather than things you found with a search engine on the open internet. You are far more likely to encounter trustworthy sources this way. Of course, it is also frequently the case that excellent information may be found on the open web; in these cases, we must use our best judgment to determine if the source is trustworthy or not. If you are confused about a source, ask your professor or one of the research librarians for assistance in making a determination.
Quick tests for peer review Here are a few test criteria that you may use to make a judgment call about whether a source has been peer reviewed:
Scholarly, peer-reviewed books are often published by an academic press associated with a college or university of repute. These publishers will have names like: Yale University Press or Duke University Press. Scholarly, peer-reviewed articles are almost always written by credentialed scholars (often the text will contain the university affiliation of the professor/author/scientist). Scholarly articles and books always have a bibliography. Scholarly articles always contain citations and commonly have footnotes or endnotes. Generally speaking, if you can find the publication at the dentist’s office or on an airport magazine rack, then it isn’t scholarly or peer-reviewed. If the article contains advertisements, it is likely not scholarly. How to find peer-reviewed sources Many periodical databases only contain peer-reviewed academic articles. A good example is JSTOR. Any article you find there will have been peer reviewed. Many other databases, such as Academic Search Complete, have search limiters that can be selected to ensure that the search results only contain peer-reviewed sources. Our own library catalog search engine provides the ability to limit the search to peer-reviewed books and periodicals.
Workshop Visit our library catalog and perform a search without the peer review box checked. Use the search string zombie AND apocalypse. What happens to the search results when you choose to filter the results by selecting peer-reviewed content in the left pane?
Visit the database Academic Search Complete and perform the same search as above. This database uses the term Scholarly (Peer Reviewed) Journals for its search limiter. What happens to the search results when you use the limiter?
Find a few other databases associated with a research topic or field of study that is important to you. You can use the Research Guides to locate them. View a few of these databases, selected at random, and see how they approach, or fail to approach, this feature.
`}),e.add({id:52,href:"/courses/workshops/working-sources/",title:"Working with Sources",content:` WR2 | Workshops Working with Sources Documentation, quotation, summary, paraphrase Perhaps the most challenging aspect of academic writing is the integration of source materials. Students often imagine that the most difficult thing about using sources is learning how and when to use a citation. While accurately documenting sources is a vital aspect of any process of inquiry, citing the page number of a source is not the only skill that is required. You must also learn how to artfully use signal phrases to announce borrowed ideas or words and transition to another source or back to your own ideas. Further, the integration of the source may occur in many forms: summary, paraphrase, or quotation (and often a mix of all three). To do any of these well requires excellent reading comprehension skills and a metacritical awareness of when it is preferable to use one form of integration over another. That&rsquo;s a lot to orchestrate and get right.
This workshop asks you to practice several key moves that are used in academic writing, all of which are described at length in the &ldquo;Working with Sources&rdquo; chapter of the Open Handbook. You will use the passage below to complete the workshop.
Completing this assignment will in no way make you proficient at the integration of sources. It will, however, help you conceptualize how sources are included in academic writing and give you a sense of what you need to work on in the future.
Source Text -From Walker Percy, &ldquo;The Loss of the Creature,&rdquo; p. 47.
Why is it almost impossible to gaze directly at the Grand Canyon under these circumstances and see it for what it is&mdash;as one picks up a strange object from one&rsquo;s back yard and gazes directly at it? It is almost impossible because the Grand Canyon, the thing as it is, has been appropriated by the symbolic complex which has already been formed in the sightseer&rsquo;s mind. Seeing the canyon under approved circumstances is seeing the symbolic complex head on. The thing is no longer the thing as it confronted the Spaniard; it is rather that which has already been formulated—by picture postcard, geography book, tourist folders, and the words Grand Canyon. As a result of this preformulation, the source of the sightseer&rsquo;s pleasure undergoes a shift. Where the wonder and delight of the Spaniard arose from his penetration of the thing itself, from a progressive discovery of depths, patterns, colors, shadows, etc., now the sightseer measures his satisfaction by the degree to which the canyon conforms to the preformed complex.
Workshop Complete the following writing exercises using the passage excerpted from Percy&rsquo;s essay above as your source text. Some of these exercises ask you to write a single sentence; others will require that you write a more lengthy response. If you are uncertain about to do summary, paraphrase, quotation, or citation, consult the readings in the handbook linked to above.
Use a signal phrase with the author’s name to introduce a quotation from this text and then cite according to MLA. (See &ldquo;in-text citations&rdquo;)
Use a signal phrase without the author&rsquo;s name to introduce a quotation and then cite according to MLA. (See &ldquo;in-text citations&rdquo;)
Use a signal phrase with the author’s name, summarize this entire passage in your own words, and then cite according to MLA. Use no quotations. Think carefully about your audience: if they have not read this piece, how should you write this so that they will understand?
Paraphrase this entire passage in your own words without using the author’s name and then cite according to MLA. Briefly quote language or terms to give the reader a sense of the &ldquo;flavor&rdquo; of the paragraph.

If you fail to properly document your sources, your readers will be unable to follow your research, validate your claims, or judge the quality of your argument. Furthermore, failing to properly cite a source (whether summarized, paraphrased, or quoted) opens you to the charge of plagiarism, a serious academic offense.
Scholars avoid plagiarism and give credit to the thinking and writing of others using a variety of citation formats, or “styles.” As you work to complete your degree in college you will encounter a number of these citation formats. In fact, each discipline has a preferred style. The humanities use MLA, psychology uses APA, history and other social sciences use Chicago. There are many others. As you begin to specialize in a particular field of study, you will be expected to use the citation style of your discipline.
Although citation formats differ significantly, they all have two primary components: in-text citations and a bibliography. As the name suggests, in-text citations are used to reference the work of others within the text itself; the bibliography contains an ordered list of all the in-text citations contained within a piece of writing.
Most students have constructed an MLA Works Cited page before they arrive at college. This assignment is designed to help you learn the Chicago style bibliography by taking advantage of your familiarity with the MLA style.
Workshop MLA to Chicago style translation Take a few moments to scan though this student essay in the Chicago style.1 Familiarize yourself with the essay&rsquo;s construction, noting especially how it differs from the MLA style essay. The following questions will help you notice some key features of the Chicago style:
How is the title page formatted compared to MLA?
Is there anything odd about the page numbering scheme?
Examine the in-text citations. How are they inserted?
How is the block quote handled differently in Chicago compared to MLA?
What is the relationship between the following entries on the Notes page: 3 and 11? 9 and 10? 3 and 4?
The Open Handbook has detailed information on formatting of both the MLA and Chicago bibliography to guide you.
Directions Your assignment is to “translate” this student essay from the MLA style into the Chicago style. Convert the document&rsquo;s formatting, page numbering, in-text citations, bibliographical entries, etc.2
To begin, download the essay to your own computer. Before you make any alterations, it might be wise to write out a detailed list of things that must be translated. The list of questions above may be of great assistance to you. You may need to consult the Open Handbook to come up with your plan of action.
You will find it difficult to force Microsoft Word into submission and make it do your bidding for the page numbering and the endnotes. While I don&rsquo;t personally use Word, Microsoft provides some advice about page numbering on their support site. Or you can download this template I ripped off from another university:
Chicago Style Template (.docx) You will also have problems if you attempt to use the automated numbered endnotes that Word creates at the end of your document. Namely, you will not be able to force Word to use the proper spacing and indentation required by the Chicago style. Therefore, I suggest that you type up a separate Notes page, bypassing Word&rsquo;s &ldquo;helpful&rdquo; feature.
As you construct your Notes page you must determine what type of source is being cited in the MLA paper. Is this a book by one author? A scholarly journal? A work in an anthology? Something else? Once you identify the type of source being referenced in the MLA paper, you can use the Open Handbook chapter on the Chicago Style to figure out how to present this type of source in the Chicago style&rsquo;s note form.
Answers Check your work with the answer key. This student essay uses section headings to organize the essay. This is a personal choice, not a strict element of the Chicago style.&#160;&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;

Workshop In a previous workshop called Working with Sources we practiced in-text citations: the references to a source&rsquo;s author and page number that you place in the body of your essay. In this workshop we will practice making the final bibliography, where you present an alphabetized list of all of the sources you used to construct your essay.
In the MLA style the final bibliography is known as the &ldquo;Works Cited&rdquo; page. The Open Handbook has detailed information on formatting the MLA bibliography; take a few moments to review the description and formatting of the Works Cited page.
Directions Your assignment is to create a Works Cited page using several provided sources as if you were using them for a paper. What is the proper way to represent them? You may use the MLA bibliography section of the Open Handbook to figure out how to cite these sources on the Works Cited page.
