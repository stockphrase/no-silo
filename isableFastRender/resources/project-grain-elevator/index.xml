      <description>Thought Machines Thought machines are tiny mechanisms designed to help us think. Some provoke our thinking by directing our attention to texts or artifacts in certain specific ways. This might help us notice certain features that had previously escaped our view. Some may help us as we write to deepen our analysis by prompting a more systematic approach to the analysis. And while these tools may be used on written texts, many of them are useful for examining other cultural objects such as film, music, art, and many other forms of cultural artifacts.</description>
