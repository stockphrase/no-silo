<p>Thought machines are tiny mechanisms designed to help us think. Some provoke our thinking by directing our attention to texts or artifacts in certain specific ways. This might help us notice certain features that had previously escaped our view. Some may help us as we write to deepen our analysis by prompting a more systematic approach to the analysis. And while these tools may be used on written texts, many of them are useful for examining other cultural objects such as film, music, art, and many other forms of cultural artifacts.</p>

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> 2) PRÉCIS: </p>
<hr>
<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> A précis is a concise summary of the essential features of a text. The summary should not be list-like; it should be a confident presentation with a nice flow and logic. Although a summary sacrifices specificity and detail in the interest of brevity, it must always remain a faithful representation of the original text. Write a tight summary of the entire argument; use <u>LIST ALL ARGUMENTS</u> as your guide. Don’t leave anything out. Don't add anything that isn't there. No opinions or evaluations. Just the facts, stated clearly. </p>

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> 3) QUICK RESPONSE: </p>
<hr>
<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> What part(s) of this essay gave you pause? Made you curious about something? Did it inspire some thought related or adjacent to its arguments? Were there references to persons or texts or ideas that you are unfamiliar with? Pick something particular and explain what the esssay inspired for you personally. Dig into these things: do some research or some writing about this. While the response genre will be personal in nature, it should not be without substance. For example, it isn't enough to say "I liked it" or "This was no good."</p>

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> 4) QUICK ARGUMENT: </p> 
<hr>
<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> Find a particular argument within the essay and make an argument of your own about it. Is the writer wrong about something? What is your reasoning for disagreeing? Perhaps you have an idea about how this idea could be extended to something else that the author doesn't discuss? If you agree with the author's thinking, should we do something concrete or change something particular in our lives based on the implications of the argument? </p>

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> 5) CLOSE READING: </p>
<hr>
<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> A passage means what it says because the author arranged a series of words together in such a way as to produce that meaning. However, once the writing is complete, and the text is out in the world, it becomes subject to interpretation by audiences. We sometimes call these ‘readings.’ A ‘close reading’ is a decoding exercise, a detailed explanation of exactly what a passage means using only the words in the passage as evidence. What do you think this passage from the text means? What is the evidence in the text that supports your view? How far can you take the analysis? You might discover a deeper interpretation if you look up certain words in the dictionary and find less common senses of the word. You might notice the way a metaphor suggests a certain perspective on the passage or how it connects to some other theme or idea in the broader text. Embrace your inner nerd here. Write an explanation of this thinking to your audience. A close reading should not be impressionistic (‘This writing sucks!’ or ‘I love it!’); or evaluative (‘This idea is important’); instead, it should focus on simply explaining to your audience what the passage means by pointing to how the text is constructed. </p>

<hr>
<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> Sketch out the ways two texts seem to be in conversation with each other on some issue, problem, or argument.

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> 9) KEY PASSAGES: </p> 
<hr>
<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> What are the key moments in the text? These will no doubt include moments where key arguments are made; however, it may also just include certain terms, turns of phrase, or memorable language that seems to invite quotation in our own writing. Imagine that you are stripping the argument for parts so that you can use them for something you are building. What are the essential, necessary items that you need to extract?</p>

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> 10) RHETORICAL ANALYSIS: </p>
<hr>
<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> Examine how the author chose to present their ideas, knowing that they could have chosen differently. For example, one author might write a traditional argument while another may choose to tell a story. A write might be furious, mocking, sarcastic; or, they may take the "high road" and try to win the audience with a high-minded and respectful form of discourse.  Were these choices effective for for you personally as a reader? What about for a broader audience?</p>

<hr>
<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> Write down a ‘big idea’ that you had today in class. This could be something someone said, an idea from a reading, or something you thought. Perhaps this idea might relate to some of your own writing in the class. Or relate to something more personal for you. This thought might be useful later, so memorialize it.</p>
