      <description>Writing 2 Writing 2 is an introduction to academic writing. The course prepares you for work in a scholarly environment where you will be expected to engage in inquiry, perform analysis, and communicate clearly. We will cultivate these critical practices by reading and analyzing a series of demanding texts and articulating responses to them in the form of essays. Shorter writing assignments will focus on a number of skills that are important for taking part in academic conversations.</description>

You might choose a certain symbol to flag arguments during your reading and textual annotations. You might use the letter A, for example.

      <description>Fall Reflection and Review This assignment takes the place of a final exam and asks you to reflect on all of your work this term. The reflections and self-evaluations you perform here will largely determine your final grade. Please write down your responses and keep them in a safe place&amp;mdash;they will be used in a conference during the first week of classes this winter term.&#xA;My rationale for this assignment is explained somewhat in question #6 in the FAQ.</description>

      <description>Essay Three: Theoretical Analysis Prompt Max Fischer has an insatiable appetite for extracurricular activities: fencing, bee-keeping, yankee racers, calligraphy, backgammon, theater, and on and on and on. These projects and clubs are forms of self-improvement&amp;mdash;kinds of sovereign inquiry&amp;mdash;but they completely dwarf his responsibilities in the traditional disciplines of formal education: geometry, history, English, etc. According to Dr. Guggenheim, Max is &amp;ldquo;one of the worst students&amp;rdquo; at Rushmore Academy.&#xA;But what might Paulo Freire argue about Max&amp;rsquo;s behavior as a human being and a scholar?</description>

      <title>Thoughts on the Post-Apocalyptic</title>

      <description>Ideas on the (Post)Apocalyptic The post-apocalyptic narrative is a fantasy or species of wish-fulfillment that expresses a desire for the end of civilization as we know it. The popularity of such films and novels suggest a range of audience responses and psychological conditions behind this wish: Economic despair and disempowering socio-economic structuring lead to a fanciful embrace of post-apocalyptic narrative as a balm, compensation, a comfort. We imagine a future where all systems of power, all hierarchies of values, all bureaucracies and governing institutions are utterly leveled, creating a landscape of pure possibility where anything is possible.</description>

      <description>Disaster, Apocalypse, and the State of Nature Reading Notes Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan (1651) Men are essentially equal when all is “reckoned together.” Equal in power, equal in common sense or wisdom. We might think that we are smarter than others, but we are mostly the same. This sense of equality leads to three causes of &amp;ldquo;quarrel&amp;rdquo;:&#xA;COMPETITION: Because we know ourselves to be equals, we become hopeful of attaining ends, goals, possessions.</description>

      <description>Stills from Night of the Living Dead (1968) Review of Night of the Living Dead by film critic Roger Ebert (1969): &amp;ldquo;The kids in the audience were stunned. There was almost complete silence. The movie had stopped being delightfully scary about halfway through, and had become unexpectedly terrifying. There was a little girl across the aisle from me, maybe nine years old, who was sitting very still in her seat and crying.</description>

      <description>The Last Man (1964) The Last Man on Earth appeared in 1964 and stars the incomparable Vincent Price. The film is the first adaptation of the 1954 novel I Am Legend by Richard Matheson. As you may know, the film was remade again in 2007 with Will Smith (who does much more than slap people in the film). We will view both of these films and I think it is helpful to try and compare them and note how the films evolve between the two historical moments.</description>
