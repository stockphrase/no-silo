<h1 id="show-dont-tell">Show, Don&rsquo;t Tell</h1>
<hr>
<p>In writing that involves outside sources it is often more powerful to <code>show</code> rather than <code>tell</code>. But what does that mean?</p>
<p>While it is an important and necessary skill to summarize or paraphrase the words of other writers using our own words, relying exclusively on this strategy may give your readers reasons to doubt your presentation of the facts. You are, in essence, telling your readers: &ldquo;Just trust me, this is accurate.&rdquo; We can call this approach <code>telling</code>.</p>
<p>Another approach is to offer your readers some proof at decisive moments by presenting the <em>actual words</em> of your source in the form of a quotation. The quotations don&rsquo;t have to be very long or involved; but when they exist, the reader will feel that your claims are more trustworthy. The reader doesn&rsquo;t have to merely trust you; now you&rsquo;ve provided some evidence. We can call this approach <code>showing</code>.</p>
<p>An overreliance on telling, even when duly cited, may weaken your rhetorical authority. In this workshop we will practice turning a <code>telling</code> sentence into a <code>showing</code> one.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s examine two approaches to representing a key passage from a course reading:</p>
<details open>
  <summary>Source Text</summary>
  <div class="markdown-inner">
    <h1 id="heading"></h1>
<p>&mdash; <em>From</em> Paulo Freire, &ldquo;The &lsquo;Banking&rsquo; Concept of Education,&rdquo; p. 72.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For apart from inquiry, apart from the praxis, individuals cannot be truly human. Knowledge emerges only through invention and reinvention, through the restless, impatient, continuing, hopeful inquiry human beings pursue in the world, with the world, and with each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="compare-the-following-sentences">Compare the following sentences:</h3>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="far fa-dot-circle"></i> <code>Telling</code></span>: Freire emphasizes that our ability to inquire is what makes us human, so taking away this part of us is taking away our humanity (72).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="far fa-dot-circle"></i> <code>Showing</code></span>: Freire maintains that our ability to ask questions and perform research are bedrock features of our humanity: &ldquo;For apart from inquiry,&rdquo; he writes, &ldquo;individuals cannot be truly human&rdquo; (72).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="far fa-dot-circle"></i> <code>Showing</code></span>: Freire insists that it is only through the &ldquo;restless, impatient, continuing, hopeful inquiry&rdquo; that we &ldquo;pursue in the world, with the world, and with each other&rdquo; that we can be &ldquo;truly human&rdquo; (72).</p>
</li>
</ul>

  </div>
</details>

<h3 id="to-review">To Review:</h3>
<p><em>Please understand</em>: there is absolutely nothing wrong with the <code>telling</code> sentence above; in fact, your writing will be full of such sentences that accurately present another author&rsquo;s ideas in your own words. However, relying on this strategy exclusively (or even just habitually) may have a negative effect on your readers&rsquo; sense of how trustworthy you seem.</p>
<p>Again, summary and paraphrase are critical skills; however, when you state that another author says X or means Y, it makes your claim much stronger if you frequently (but judiciously) use the <em>actual words or terms</em> the author chooses. Now your reader doesn&rsquo;t just have to &ldquo;trust&rdquo; you, they can see for themselves.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="workshop">Workshop</h2>
<h3 id="directions">Directions:</h3>
<p>Rewrite the following three <code>telling</code> sentences to make two separate <code>showing</code> ones. Your second sentence should use a completely new sentence structure, as in the example above.</p>
<details >
  <summary>Passage 1</summary>
  <div class="markdown-inner">
    <h1 id="heading"></h1>
<p>&mdash; <em>From</em> Paulo Freire, &ldquo;The &lsquo;Banking&rsquo; Concept of Education,&rdquo; p. 72.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Education thus becomes an act of depositing, in which the students are the depositories and the teacher is the depositor. Instead of communicating, the teacher issues communiqués and makes deposits which the students patiently receive, memorize, and repeat. This is the &ldquo;banking&rdquo; concept of education, in which the scope of action allowed to the students extends only as far as receiving, filing, and storing the deposits.</p>

  <summary>Passage 2</summary>
  <div class="markdown-inner">
    <h1 id="heading"></h1>
<p>&mdash; <em>From</em> Walker Percy, &ldquo;The Loss of the Creature,&rdquo; p. 47.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Seeing the canyon under approved circumstances is seeing the symbolic complex head on. The thing is no longer the thing as it confronted the Spaniard; it is rather that which has already been formulated—by picture postcard, geography book, tourist folders, and the words Grand Canyon. As a result of this preformulation, the source of the sightseer’s pleasure undergoes a shift. Where the wonder and delight of the Spaniard arose from his penetration of the thing itself, from a progressive discovery of depths, patterns, colors, shadows, etc., now the sightseer measures his satisfaction by the degree to which the canyon conforms to the preformed complex.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="far fa-dot-circle"></i> <code>Telling</code></span>: Walker Percy argues that it is now extraordinarily difficult to see the Grand Canyon in an original way because of our prior exposure to images and descriptions of the place (47).</li>

<p><span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen"></i> <code>Showing 1</code>:</span> Percy argues that we no longer see the Grand Canyon authentically and without influence as its original discoverer could; instead, we must view the place through &ldquo;approved circumstances,&rdquo; through a complex lens comprised of all the images, descriptions, and representations of the place that we have been exposed to in our lifetimes (72).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fa-solid fa-pen"></i> <code>Showing 2</code>:</span> For Percy, viewing the canyon as its original discoverer did is now virtually impossible since our view is now conditioned by what he calls &ldquo;preformulation,&rdquo; an exposure to symbolic representations such as a &ldquo;picture postcard, geography book, tourist folders, and the words Grand Canyon&rdquo; (47).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We must not overlook sudden conversions and wrenching insights, but usually we fasten on to these only in hindsight, and exaggerate them for the sake of narrative&mdash;a tool perfected by the great nineteenth-century novelists, who sit their heroines down and have them deduce the intolerability of their situation in one unhappy night, as the fire burns itself into embers in the grate.</p>
</blockquote>

<li><span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="far fa-dot-circle"></i> <code>Telling</code></span>: Baker warns us that the detection of a change of mind often sends us on an investigation into the past, where we make up false narratives to help explain why our opinions change (7).</li>

<!---
A student essay example:

Percy and Freire both explain the dire consequences of the education system that limits the minds of students in a similar way. Percy highlights the negative impact that occurs when students see things as they are presented to them without thinking critically. His main issue with this loss of sovereignty is that students are blinded to the things they encounter and miss out on all of the knowledge they could have gained. Freire, on the other hand, focuses on the dehumanization of students that are brought up in an oppressive school system that takes away their ability to think for themselves. He emphasizes that our ability to ask questions is what makes us human, so taking away this part of us is taking away our given liberties of being human.
