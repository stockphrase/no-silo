# Definition of plagiarism


In the [Academic Honor Principle](http://www.dartmouth.edu/judicialaffairs/honor/index.html),
Dartmouth College defines plagiarism as

> the submission or presentation of work, in any form, that is not a
> student's own, without acknowledgment of the source. With specific
> regard to papers, a simple rule dictates when it is necessary to
> acknowledge sources. If a student obtains information or ideas from an
> outside source, that source must be acknowledged. Another rule to
> follow is that any direct quotation must be placed in quotation marks,
> and the source immediately cited. Students are responsible for the
> information concerning plagiarism found in [*Sources and Citations at
> Dartmouth
> College*](http://writing-speech.dartmouth.edu/learning/materials/sources-and-citations-dartmouth).

Consult the [Academic Honor Principle](http://www.dartmouth.edu/judicialaffairs/honor/index.html)
for more information on academic dishonesty and a description of its severe consequences.

# Examples of plagiarism


While plagiarism appears in many forms and degrees, we may broadly
classify them in three categories:

1. the wholesale copying of another's essay or project

2. the adoption of certain phrases or words from another text without proper attribution (also known as "patchwriting")

3. the paraphrase of another's writing without proper attribution or citation.

Below you will find examples of these three categories of plagiarism, each one using a passage from Patricia Nelson Limerick's
1987 book, *The Legacy of Conquest*:

<div class="container">
        <div class="raised-edge">

<div style="text-align:center">{{< figure src="/img/source.png" width=100 >}}</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When academic territories were parceled out in the early twentieth
century, anthropology got the tellers of tales and history got the
keepers of written records. As anthropology and history diverged, human
differences that hinged on literacy assumed an undeserved significance.
Working with oral, preindustrial, prestate societies, anthropologists
acknowledged the power of culture and of a received worldview; they knew
that the folk conception of the world was not narrowly tied to proof and
evidence. But with the disciplinary boundary overdrawn, it was easy for
historians to assume that literacy, the modern state, and the commercial
world had produced a different sort of creature entirely---humans less
inclined to put myth over reality, more inclined to measure their
beliefs by the standard of accuracy and practicality. (35)

## Word-for-word copying

Word-for-word copying, such as the following example, is completely
unacceptable whether it occurs by mistake or design. Care must be taken
when taking notes and typing quotations to avoid representing the words
of other authors as your own:

>As we all know, <span class="highlight">when academic territories were parceled out in the early twentieth century, anthropology got the tellers of tales and history got the keepers of written records.</span> This made historians <span class="highlight">assume that literacy, the modern state, and the commercial world had produced a different sort of creature entirely---humans less inclined to put myth over reality, more inclined to measure their beliefs by the standard of accuracy and practicality.</span>

- This passage fails to use quotation marks to indicate borrowed language.
- It additionally fails to cite the source of the borrowed language.


## Patchwriting

This form of plagiarism is often the result of sloppiness in the
note-taking or drafting process. Using patches of a source text is
perfectly reasonable; however, make sure that quotation marks are used
and citations are given:

> When the <span class="highlight">academic territories were parceled out in the early 1900s</span>, the disciplines <span class="highlight">diverged</span>. This made the differences that human beings had with regard to literacy <span class="highlight">assume an undeserved significance</span>. By <span class="highlight">overdrawing this disciplinary boundary</span>, historians began to believe that the subjects they studied were <span class="highlight">less inclined to put myth over reality</span> and more likely <span class="highlight">to measure their beliefs</span> through the excellent standards of <span class="highlight">accuracy and practicality</span> (Limerick 35).

- While this student does acknowledge the source she is borrowing from, she fails to enclose words and phrases that come directly from the text.

## Paraphrase without attribution

The following paraphrase would be perfectly acceptable were it to have a
[**signal phrase**](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8) and a [**citation**](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-11) indicating that the ideas were taken
from another author's work. Even though no language was taken directly
from the source text, *the ideas must be attributed to the author* from
whom they were borrowed. As it stands now, the author is declaring that
he came up with these ideas and arguments himself:

> During the early part of the last century the disciplines of
> anthropology and history separated. While anthropology focused on
> unlettered and illiterate communities, history became the study of
> societies who produced texts and records. Within the field of
> anthropology, a firm belief developed that oral cultures were
> characterized by mythological worldviews and superstitious beliefs; on
> the other hand, historians assumed that literate cultures were filled
> with individuals who only used reason and evidence to guide their
> thinking.

- This is an excellent [**paraphrase**](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8) of the text. But it is still plagiarism unless you cite it appropriately.
