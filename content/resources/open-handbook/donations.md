# Donations

Students who would like to make a small gift in honor of this project are encouraged to make electronic donations to the [New Hampshire Food Bank](http://www.nhfoodbank.org/), a nonprofit organization that feeds other Granite Staters in need. 

- `Every $1 you donate provides two meals to someone who can't afford one.`
