## MLA document formatting

When setting up your word processor for an MLA-formatted document, use
the following settings to format your page:

{{< details "MLA Page Formatting" closed >}}

- Set one-inch margins on all sides of the document.

- Double-space the entire document, including block quotes.

- In the top left portion of the first page, type your name, instructor's name, course title, and date on separate, double-spaced lines.

- Include your last name and a page number on each page in the top right corner of the header.

- Include a centered title on the first page.

- Indent the first line of each paragraph with a tab set to 1/2 inch.

### Example:

{{< figure src="/img/mla-pageformat.png" >}}

{{< /details >}}

MLA requires a bibliography at the conclusion of the essay that includes
the full citation of the sources cited within the essay. In MLA the
bibliography is known as the `Works Cited` page. When formatting a
Works Cited page, use the following rules:

{{< details "MLA Works Cited page formatting" closed >}}
#

- Center the words "Works Cited" at the top of the page.

- Use your last name and the page number on the right side of the page's header.

- Double space the entries.

- Alphabetize the entries by the author's last name.

- If an entry runs more than one typed line, indent the second (and any subsequent) line with a 1/2-inch tab.

- If two or more works by the same author are used, list the entries alphabetically by title. After the first entry, replace the author's name with three dashes followed by a period.

### Example:

{{< figure src="/img/mla-works-cited.png" >}}

{{< /details >}}


When a [**quotation**](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8/) runs more than four typed lines, use a `block quote`. A block quote is a freestanding block of quoted words, set apart from the rest of the text. When formatting block quotes in MLA, use the following rules:

{{< details "MLA Block Quote Formatting" closed >}}

#

-   Begin the block quote on a new line.

-   Indent every line of the quote 1 inch from the left margin (this
    should be two tabs).

-   Do not use quotation marks around the quoted material.

-   Place the parenthetical citation *after* the final punctuation of
    the quoted passage.
    
### Example:

{{< figure src="/img/mla-blockquote.png" >}}

{{< /details >}}


## MLA in-text citations

The MLA style uses `parenthetical citations` within a document to indicate the author and
page number of sources. Each time a source is used in your text, the author's name and the page number of the source are placed in a parenthesis within your document. These in-text citations correspond to a full bibliographic entry for the source located in the essay's `Works Cited` page at the conclusion of the essay. 

{{< details "MLA In-text Citations" closed >}} 

#

The MLA style parenthetical citations primarily take two forms:

**1.** One form is used when the source you are citing *is named or understood* by your audience: 
> According to scholar James Frey, "Each American consumes five pounds of ice cream annually" (78).

- In this first sentence the author is referred to only as a generic "scholar." To give the reader information on which scholar is being cited, Frey's name is included in the parenthetical citation.


**2.** The other form is used when the author being cited is *unknown or unclear* based on the context:
> According to scholar James Frey, "Each American consumes five pounds of ice cream annually" (78).

- In the second example the author describes the *report*, not its author; as a result, the student has included Frey's name to the citation to indicate whose report is being referenced.

The in-text citations described above will comprise virtually all of your citations. However, there are a few circumstances when the in-text citations will require a different approach.

**3.** For media that has a `runtime`---like film, television, or music---MLA requires that you cite a timestamp within your in-text citations. Use colons to separate hours, minutes, and seconds. For example:

> According to Rushmore Academy's headmaster, Max is "probably the worst student" at the school (04:04-07).

or

> In "Don't Hurt Yourself," Beyoncé proclaims "I am the dragon breathing fire" (01:13-15).

**4.** For citations when the author is unknown, use an abbreviated version of the work's title in the parenthetical citation. If no page number is available (for example, if the source was found on the web), just use the abbreviated title in the citation and provide the full bibliographic entry in the Works Cited page:

> Accordingly, the moose population in New Hampshire is suffering from the increased tick population ("Not Moosing Around").

**5.** If the source was written by a `corporate author`, you may use the name of the company, government office, or organization who published the piece in place of the author:

> Scientists declare that this will be the hottest year on record (NOAA 234).

## The MLA core elements


The eighth edition of the *MLA Handbook*, published in 2016, issued
sweeping changes to the formatting of the MLA bibliography. The previous
seven editions of the handbook---stretching back to the 1930s---attempted to provide a model citation for
every type of source. However, the explosion of internet-based sources
and new forms of communication and media made the project of providing
guidance on every type of source extremely challenging.

The new handbook replaces the creation of an ever-growing list of source
types with a set of universal guidelines that may be used to formulate a
citation for any type of source. These guidelines are referred to as the
"core elements." The promise of this new approach to the MLA bibliography is that 
it provides a method for citing any type of source, even those that do not yet exist.

{{< details "Using the core elements" >}}

#

The MLA core elements below are listed in the order they should appear in your own bibliography. The proper punctuation that should follow each element is also provided. Thus, you will begin the entry with the author(s) name, followed by a period. Then the title of the work will be provided, followed by a period. Then the title of the container, followed by a comma. And so on. If one of these core elements does not apply to your source, skip it and move to the next one until you have been through the entire list of elements. 


| Core Element   | Concluding Punctuation     
|:----------|:-------------
| Author | .
| Title | .
| Title of container (self contained if book) | ,
| Other contributors (translators or editors) | ,
| Version (edition)| ,
| Number (vol. and/or no.)  | ,
| Publisher| ,
| Publication Date | ,
| Location (pages, paragraphs URL or DOI)  | .


- <span class="highlight">*Note that some sources will have more than one container*.</span> If so, you will have to proceed through the second table listed below to complete your bibliographic entry:

| Core Element   | Concluding Punctuation     
|:----------|:-------------
| 2nd container's title | ,
| Other contributors (translators or editors) | ,
| Version | ,
| Number | ,
| Publisher | ,
| Publication date | ,
| Location | ,
| Date of Access (if needed) | .
                     

## Using the MLA core elements


### 1. Author.

The first element of a citation is the author's name. Since the MLA
bibliography is organized alphabetically by the author's last name,
begin your citations with the author's last name, followed by a comma,
then the author's first name. If a middle name or initial are supplied,
include those after the first name in the entry. Conclude the author
element with a period. Sources will often have multiple authors. In
that case, only the first listed author will use the Last Name, First
Name structure. For example:


{{< mla-ref >}}
Taylor, Alan. *A Tour of New Hampshire's Wolf Trees*. Little and Sons, 1998.

Greely, Fred, Mary Jones, and Rick Flair. *There's a Bat in My Attic: Struggles with the New Hampshire Brown Bat*. Wildlife Press, 2012.
{{< /mla-ref >}}

---

### 2. Title of source.

The title of a source is italicized if it is considered
"self-contained" and "independent." Sources that are part of a
larger whole, however, are placed in quotation marks. For example, a
book is a self-contained and independent source; however, a *chapter in
a book* is part of a larger whole. Thus, the title of the book will be
italicized while the title of the chapter will appear in quotation
marks. Similarly, a television series is an independent whole, so its
title will be italicized. However, an episode within the television
series is part of the larger program, so its title appears in
quotations. For example:

{{< mla-ref >}}

San, Rathanak. <span class="highlight">*Escaping Vietnam*</span>. Peach Publishing, 1988.

Taylor, James. <span class="highlight">"The Indian Matter of Charles Brockden Brown's Writings."</span> *American Literature*, vol. 45, no. 6, 1998, pp. 432-45.

<span class="highlight">"Say My Name."</span> *Breaking Bad*, created by Vince Gilligan, performance by Brian Cranston, season 5, episode 7, AMC, 2012.

{{< /mla-ref >}}

---

MLA has a standardized approach to the `capitalization of titles`.
Regardless of how the title appears on a title page, scholarly journal,
or database, use the following information to properly capitalize the
title of your source on your Works Cited page:

-   Capitalize nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and
    subordinating conjunctions.

-   Unless they begin the title, do not capitalize articles,
    prepositions, coordinating conjunctions, or the "to" in infinitive
    verbs.

---

### 3. Title of container,

Many kinds of sources are smaller parts of larger wholes. MLA refers to
these larger wholes as `containers`. For example, a chapter is a
smaller part of a book. In this sense, the book is the container for the
chapter. Similarly, a scholarly article is a smaller part of the
scholarly journal that contains it. Newspaper articles, essays in a
collection, and television episodes are all contained by a larger
whole. These containers are italicized in your bibliography. For
example, here are the citations for an article in a scholarly journal
and a work in a collection of essays:


{{< mla-ref >}}

Taylor, James. "The Indian Matter of Charles Brockden Brown's Writings." <span class="highlight">*American Literature*</span>, vol. 45, no. 6, 1998, pp. 432-45.

Cranston, William. "My Famous Donkey." <span class="highlight">*Short Stories of East Tennessee*</span>, edited by Jax Ridley, East Tennessee State P, 2011, pp. 77-90.

{{< /mla-ref >}}

Some sources have multiple containers. This is often true for electronic sources. For example, a scholarly article may be contained by both the journal that originally published it and the academic research database that hosts it online. Consider an article published in the academic database called [JSTOR](https://www.jstor.org):

{{< mla-ref >}}

Taylor, James. "The Indian Matter of Charles Brockden Brown's Writings." <span class="highlight">*American Literature*</span>, vol. 45, no. 6, 1998, pp. 432-45. <span class="highlight">*JSTOR*</span>, www.jstor.org/stable/8759038475.

{{< /mla-ref >}}


When citing a source make sure that you represent *every* container so as to truly represent where that source was discovered. 

---


### 4. Other contributors,

Your sources will often have a number of other individuals who contributed to the work besides the author(s). You may find sources with one or more of these additional roles:

-   director

-   editor

-   illustrator

-   introducer

-   narrator

-   performer

-   translator

---

### 5. Version,

Many sources are published in more than one version. The most common
version you will encounter in academic research is a new version of a
book. Each new version of a book is described as an `edition`. These
versions are numbered in sequential order: 1st edition, 2nd edition, 3rd
edition, and so on. There are other kinds of versions, some of which are
illustrated below.


{{< mla-ref >}}

Anderson, Wes. *Rushmore*. 1998. Performance by Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman, <span class="highlight">director's cut</span>, Buena Vista International, 2017.

*The Bible*. <span class="highlight">Authorized King James Version</span>, Oxford UP, 1998.

David, Gray. *Blister in the Sun: A Day in the Life of an Aging Rock Star*. <span class="highlight">Revised ed.</span>, Primer Publishing, 1993.

Smith, John. *Raising Arizona*. <span class="highlight">3rd ed.</span>, Primer Publishing, 1993.

{{< /mla-ref >}}


Always ensure that you cite the exact version that you use in your
writing. Pagination often differs between editions; versions of a film
or other media may vary significantly or have additional content.
Failing to cite the specific version of a text will lead to confusion
and may make your readers feel that you are sloppy or uncaring.

---

### 6. Number,

Many sources are part of a numbered sequence. For the most part you will
encounter this in `journal articles` and books that are part of a
`numbered series`.

Journal articles are often collected together in volumes and numbered issues:


{{< mla-ref >}}
Taylor, James. "The Indian Matter of Charles Brockden Brown's Writings." *American Literature*, <span class="highlight">vol. 45, no. 6</span>, 1998, pp. 432-45.
{{< /mla-ref >}}


Some journals do not collect issues into numbered volumes; instead, they only publish numbered issues:


{{< mla-ref >}}
Clampers, Smitty. "Genocide in South America." *Journal of Violence*, <span class="highlight">no. 7</span>, 1990, pp. 221-75.
{{< /mla-ref >}}


When books are too large to be published as a single text, they are organized in volumes:


{{< mla-ref >}}
Smith, Jeb. *A History of American Serial Killers*. <span class="highlight">Vol. 6</span>, Samford UP, 2012.
{{< /mla-ref >}}

---

### 7. Publisher,

A publisher is the business or organization responsible for bringing a
book, article, website, or other type of source to the public. Books
will commonly indicate the publisher on the title or copyright pages,
which will be the first few pages of the text:


{{< mla-ref >}}
Lund, Frank. *The Gravest of Errors*. <span class="highlight">Indiana UP</span>, 2012.
{{< /mla-ref >}}


Websites or blogs may not have clear indications for the
publisher. However, this information is often included in the footer at
the bottom of a homepage or on "About" or "Contact" pages:


{{< mla-ref >}}
Teeter, Graham. "My Time Alone in Vietnam, a Travel Tale." *Narratives from the Edge*, <span class="highlight">Society of World Geographers and Adventurers</span>, www.edgenarratives.com/teeter.
{{< /mla-ref >}}


Television series and films are often created by a large array of
producers and companies. However, cite only the organization that had
the primary responsibility for production:


{{< mla-ref >}}
Anderson, Wes. *Rushmore*. Performance by Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman, <span class="highlight">Buena Vista International</span>, 1998.
{{< /mla-ref >}}


The MLA stylebook explains several situations where a publisher's name
is *not* required in the citation:

-   A periodical (academic journal, newspaper, magazine, etc.)

-   A work published by its author.

-   A website whose title is essentially the name of the publisher.

-   A website that does not help produce the source, only host it
    (academic database, YouTube, etc.)

Be careful, however, to include things like the electronic database name
or platforms like YouTube as `containers`, described above.

---

### 8. Publication date,

Most sources appropriate for academic research will clearly disclose the
date, or dates, of publication. This information will often appear in
the front matter of books or journals, or in the masthead of newspapers.

Online sources, however, present a problem. Sometimes it is unclear when
an online source was published. Other times the online source may be a
digital version of a print source which may have been published at a
different time.

When a source has more than one publication date, cite only the version
that you are using in your own writing. For example, if you are citing a
newspaper article you read online, you should cite the date disclosed on
the online version, not the corresponding print version. Failing to do
this may cause problems if the online version was edited after the
newspaper went to print.

---

### 9. Location,

The location of a source largely refers to a source's page number, or numbers. However, many types of sources do not have page numbers. A web page's location, for example, is a URL. And a painting or some other artwork's location would be the physical location of the museum where you viewed it in person. 

- A chapter in a book:


{{< mla-ref >}}
Tate, Justin. "Ordering Wine in Paris." *An American's Guide to French Cuisine*, U of Tennessee P, 1989, <span class="highlight">pp. 45-61</span>.
{{< /mla-ref >}}


If the source is only on a single page, use `p.` rather than `pp.` to indicate the page number.

- A website:


{{< mla-ref >}}
Grisham, Wyatt. "A Soccer Mom's Lament." *Sports and Parenting*, 28 Oct. 2017, <span class="highlight">www.sandp.org/soccermomslament</span>.
{{< /mla-ref >}}


URLs can be challenging to present because of their length or mutable nature. If possible, use what is known as a "stable url" or "permalink"---a permanent URL associated with online content. These permalinks will not change over time. You may also find online content with a `DOI`, a digital object identifier. You may cite this DOI in place of a URL. If a URL is too long to include in your bibliography, you may use a shortened version of the URL by citing the domain name of the source (for example: www.nytimes.com).


- A material object or work of art:

Wayins, Brill. *Lone Pine Tree*. 2001, <span class="highlight">Hood Museum of Art, Hanover</span>.

**Note**: *In previous versions of the style, MLA required the city of the publisher to be included. This is no longer a requirement of the style.*

## The MLA bibliography

While the new edition of the MLA Handbook largely dispenses with specific templates for making citations, I have retained the following examples for this edition of the *Open Handbook*. I find that these examples are still a helpful guide, especially for students who lack experience with this style of citation. 

The following section provides examples for citing sources that are commonly found in academic writing. The various forms have been organized into sections on **books**, **periodicals**, **electronic sources**, and **other types of sources** that are less common.
