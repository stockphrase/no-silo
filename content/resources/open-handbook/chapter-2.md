# Chapter Two: Critical Notes

---
  <small>

We believe the best way to work on a difficult text is by rereading
. . . but you can also work on the difficult text by writing, by
taking possession of the work through sentences and paragraphs of your
own, through summary, paraphrase, and quotation, by making another
writer's work part of your work (12).

"Our notes should, indeed, be useful for purposes of review; yet that usefulness is not their chief value. They should be full, yet contain only what the mind has accepted as significant. The practical value of our notes will take care of itself as a matter of secondary importance, if we devote ourselves wholly to their main purpose—to make us alert, clear-headed, and responsible as we listen to a lecture [or read a text], and to serve as a ready test of the firmness of our grasp. To take good notes is not preliminary to study, but study itself of the most vital kind; calling at once on all one's powers of concentration, judgment, and craftsmanship" (6)

--- Samuel Seward, [*Note-Taking*](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Note_taking/PSiVLIcLVIoC?hl=en), 1910

## Taking critical notes


One objective of the annotations described in the previous chapter is to
help you create a `critical outline` during a subsequent reading. The
objective in the critical outline is to boil the entire argument down to
its essence without losing any significant detail. The focus, then, is on
*reduction*: taking something complex and unwieldy and turning it
into something small and useful for study or your own writing. There is
a real art to this, and you will become better and faster at this as you
practice. Over time, you will train your mind to operate in such a way
that you will perform these tasks almost unconsciously as you read.
These critical notes will be indispensable study aids. They will also
dramatically improve your writing since key information, important passages, and
significant quotations from the text will be easily accessible to you with minimal recovery efforts.

These critical summaries are comprised of nothing more than [summary](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8), [paraphrase](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8), [quotation](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8), and your own observations and questions. Quote only the most important, memorable language.
Summarize or paraphrase the rest in as objective a manner as possible.
Take great care when summarizing or paraphrasing; if your work is too
similar to the original text and is used later in your own writing, you
may inadvertently commit [plagiarism](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-10), a serious academic offense.
Therefore, carefully place the writing of others into your own words and
[cite](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-11) the text and ideas you reference in your notes.

As you write this critical outline you will not only try to reduce the
main points of the argument, you will also ask questions and make
observations of the text. You should note the argumentative points that
you find yourself strongly agreeing or disagreeing with and your reasons
for doing so. You might see a logical inconsistency or want the author
to provide more evidence for his or her claims. You might make a note to
perform some research at the library or on the Internet on an unfamiliar
concept or event mentioned in the argument. Ultimately, however, you
will want to determine if the [argument](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-6) you have read is persuasive and
provide the reasons why.

At the end of this process, you should have a simplified---but objective
and accurate---version of the essay that has been ruthlessly cut down to
its bare essentials as well as a number of critical observations,
questions, and ideas that have emerged in your process of reading. By
the time you reach this stage and read over your notes, you will have
taken great strides toward understanding the information or argument. Of
course, if the text is difficult, you may have to repeat the process
until you have a breakthrough. I cannot emphasize enough how helpful and
important this process is. It will help you arrive at a greater
understanding of the text's claims and weaknesses while also activating
your long-term memory.

Finally, to be a successful student and scholar, you will need to
[preserve your notes](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-4/) for later use. You might use a series of organized
folders on your computer or some kind of filing system in manila
folders. Whatever works best for you. Retaining all of this hard work
will be of great importance to you later, particularly as you engage in
large [research](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-12) projects. As I describe in the next chapter,
being a scholar---or just a great student---involves reusing and re-purposing
prior work and information.

## How to take in-class notes

You might consider taking your notes on paper. [Some research](https://sites.udel.edu/victorp/files/2010/11/Psychological-Science-2014-Mueller-0956797614524581-1u0h0yu.pdf) suggests that taking notes by hand, [rather than using a computer](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/), [boosts brain activity](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1219945 ), aids memory, and improves student performance:

>Obviously it is advantageous to draft more complete notes that precisely capture the course content and allow for a verbatim review of the material at a later date.  Only it isn’t.  New research by Pam Mueller and Daniel Oppenheimer demonstrates that students who write out their notes on paper actually learn more.  Across three experiments, Mueller and Oppenheimer had students take notes in a classroom setting and then tested students on their memory for factual detail, their conceptual understanding of the material, and their ability to synthesize and generalize the information.  Half of the students were instructed to take notes with a laptop, and the other half were instructed to write the notes out by hand.  As in other studies, students who used laptops took more notes.  In each study, however, those who wrote out their notes by hand had a stronger conceptual understanding and were more successful in applying and integrating the material than those who used took notes with their laptops.

- Of course, we're all different with unique strengths and challenges. So this advice may not be appropriate for everyone.

## Critical notes strategies

Developing a process for making critical notes is perhaps the most
important new habit you will need to be successful in college. Here are
some strategies or principles that may guide your efforts:

-   **Reduce**. Use [summary](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8), [paraphrase](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8), [quotation](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8), to reduce an argument to its bare bones.

-   **Engage**. Grapple with the ideas and arguments in the text. Ask
    questions and make observations. You should note the argumentative
    points that you find yourself strongly agreeing or disagreeing with
    and your reasons for doing so. You might see a logical inconsistency
    or want the author to provide more evidence for his or her claims.
    You might make a note to perform some research on an unfamiliar
    word, concept, or event mentioned in the argument.

-   **Protect yourself**. Be scrupulous when you [summarize](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8) and [paraphrase](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8) source materials in your notes by ensuring that you
    use your own language and sentence structure. A lazy mistake at this
    stage may cost you dearly later if you inadvertently [plagiarize](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-10)
    material. Don't forget to meticulously cite the page numbers of all
    the information you include in your notes.

-   **Save your work.** You will need to create a system for [organizing and retaining these annotations and notes](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-4) for
    later use. You might use a series of organized folders on your
    computer or some kind of filing system in manila folders. Whatever
    works best for you.
