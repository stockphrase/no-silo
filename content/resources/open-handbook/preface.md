# Preface

College students are commonly required to purchase handbooks for use in
their writing courses. These reference texts introduce students to the
conventions of academic writing and often include chapters on `academic
research,` `critical thinking,` `grammar,` and `formal citation.`

The knowledge contained in these texts is indispensable. However, most
handbooks on the market today are bloated in both content and price (I
think the former is often the justification for the latter). For
example, the institution where I formerly worked required students to
purchase a handbook that was over 900 pages long and cost around $60. I
think that is too long and too much.

My goal for this project is to create a brief handbook with everything
students need to successfully navigate their college writing
assignments, then give it away for free.

You're welcome!
