# Using this Text

I've created three types of highlighting or link styling in this text: 


| Keyword   |   Style | Note    
|:----------|:-------------:|:---------|
| Keyword  |  `text` | A term you should know as a college student.
| *External* links |  [text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRHA0) | A link to a resource or information outside this text.
| *Internal* links | [**text**]() | A topic covered in more depth located elsewhere within this text.
