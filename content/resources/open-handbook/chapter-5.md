# What is Good Writing?

---

Academic writing takes many forms. However, all *good* academic writing
shares several basic characteristics:

-   **Good academic writing always contains a strong thesis statement**---an idea, stated as an assertion, that is the work's central focus.

-   **Good academic writing is organized**: each [**paragraph**](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-7)
    builds upon the one before it, creating a strong sense of purpose.
    The paragraphs themselves are unified, generally pursuing a single
    idea that helps support the `thesis.` Each paragraph should use a
    strong [**topic sentence**](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-7) that clearly indicates the subject of the
    paragraph.

-   **Good academic writing has elegant and logical transitions** between paragraphs and ideas.

-   **Good academic writing shows an awareness of the needs of its particular [**audience**](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-3)** by contextualizing the ideas, texts, authors, debates, theories, or histories that are discussed within it.

-   **Good academic writing is relevant, useful, and interesting** to its intended [**audience**](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-3).

-   **Good academic writing skillfully uses appropriate evidence** to support claims and it properly credits outside sources with [**citations**](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-11).

-   **Good academic writing is clear and concise**.
