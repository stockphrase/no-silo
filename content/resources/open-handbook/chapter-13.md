# Common Sentence Errors

---

A [statistical study of student writing](http://www.jstor.org/stable/357695) performed in 1988 by scholars Andrea Lunsford and Robert Connors demonstrated that virtually 100% student writing mistakes are limited to 20 formal errors. Eliminating these errors in your writing therefore offers the quickest path to error-free prose.

### 1. Missing comma after an introductory element

Introductory words or clauses are usually set off with a comma:

- >{{< fa times >}} Similarly Freire argues that memorization is dehumanizing.

- >{{< fa check >}} Similarly, Freire argues that memorization is dehumanizing.

---

- >{{< fa times >}} If the team wants to win they will have to practice more.

- >{{< fa check >}} If the team wants to win, they will have to practice more.

---

### 2. Wrong word

- >{{< fa times >}}  The workmen assembled at the <span class="highlight">cite</span>.

- >{{< fa check >}}  The workmen assembled at the site.

---

- >{{< fa times >}}  I have a bad case of <span class="highlight">ammonia</span>.

- >{{< fa check >}}   I have a bad case of pneumonia.

---

### 3. Incomplete or missing documentation

Missing documentation for a quotation, summary, or paraphrase of another text may result in [plagiarism](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-10), a serious academic infraction:

- >{{< fa times >}} The response to the threat of terrorism should not be a curtailing of freedoms.

- >{{< fa check >}} The response to the threat of terrorism should not be a curtailing
    of freedoms (Vindman 29).


---

### 4. Vague pronoun reference

- >{{< fa times >}}  The teacher gave her notes to her.

- >{{< fa check >}}  The teacher gave her notes to Jane.

---

### 5. Spelling error

- >{{< fa times >}}  I <span class="highlight">definately</span> will be there.

- >{{< fa check >}}  I definitely will be there.

---


### 6. Faulty Parallelism

Parallel structure involves using the same form of words or structural
pattern when crafting a sentence. In the example above, the author uses
gerunds for the first two verbs but then changes to the infinitive form
for the last verb. Generally, parallel structure sounds much better to
the ear than otherwise:

- >{{< fa times >}}   He was good at swearing, fighting, and liked to drink.

- >{{< fa check >}}  He was good at swearing, fighting, and drinking.

---

- >{{< fa times >}}  They were informed that they should not eat before swimming, that
    they should not eat sugar, and to do some exercises before bed.

- >{{< fa check >}}  They were informed that they should not eat before swimming, that
    they should not eat sugar, and that they should not skip exercise
    before bed.


---

### 7. Unnecessary comma

Only use a comma before a coordinating conjunction if you are connecting two *independent clauses*: 

- >{{< fa times >}} The legal language applies to carnivals, but not amusement parks.

- >{{< fa check >}} The legal language applies to carnivals but not amusement parks.

---

The phrase "who held the American flag" is a *restrictive* element---a part of a sentence that is essential its meaning. This information
identifies the particular man who waved from all the others on the bus. Restrictive elements are not set off with commas.

- >{{< fa times >}} The man, who held the American flag, waved to us from the tour bus.

- >{{< fa check >}} The man who held the American flag waved to us from the tour bus.

### 8. Missing comma with a nonrestrictive element

A **nonrestrictive element** is a part of a sentence that is not essential to its meaning. Commas are used to set off these nonessential portions of the sentence:

- >{{< fa check >}} The Boston Red Sox, who are my favorite baseball team, are having a rough time with middle relievers. 


### 9. Missing comma in compound sentence

A compound sentence contains two or more clauses that can stand alone as complete sentences (otherwise known as "independent clauses"). However, to connect them as a single sentence you must either use a semicolon or a comma and a coordinating conjunction: *for, and, not, but, or, yet, so*. (You can remember these with the acrostic **F.A.N.B.O.Y.S.**) Failing to punctuate the compound sentence properly results in a **fused**, or **run-on**, sentence:

- >{{< fa times >}} I am building a bunker in my backyard but I am not fearful of a zombie outbreak.

- >{{< fa check >}} I am building a bunker in my backyard, but I am not fearful of a zombie outbreak.


### 10. Faulty sentence structure

When a sentence begins with a certain structure, then abruptly shifts to a different one, it becomes disorderly and difficult to follow.

- >{{< fa times >}} With so much going on in the world today is why it is so hard to keep up with everything.

- >{{< fa check >}} With so much going on in the world, it can be hard to keep up.


### 11. Unnecessary shift in verb tense


- >{{< fa times >}} She ran to the store and picks up some milk.

- >{{< fa check >}} She ran to the store and picked up some milk.

### 12. Lack of agreement between pronoun and antecedent

Pronouns and their antecedents must always agree in number. There are three rules
that govern the choice between singular or plural pronouns: 1) Sentences that
begin with an indefinite pronoun (such as everyone and each) are
*always* treated as singular. 2) If antecedents are joined by *or* or
*nor*, the pronoun must agree with the *closer* antecedent. 3)
Collective nouns can be either singular or plural depending on whether
the people are seen as a single unit or a group of individuals:

- >{{< fa times >}}Each of the prisoners found happiness in their work.

- >{{< fa check >}}Each of the prisoners found happiness in his work.

---

- >{{< fa times >}} Either Jeff or Robert will be required to give up their car.

- >{{< fa check >}} Either Jeff or Robert will be required to give up his car.

---

- >{{< fa check >}} The campaign constantly changed its positions in the weeks before
    the election.

- >{{< fa check >}} The campaign constantly changed their positions in the weeks before
    the election.

### 13. Missing or misplaced possessive apostrophe


- >{{< fa times >}} The Baker Hill farm stand is proud to offer <span class="highlight">it's</span> vegetables for sale now.

- >{{< fa check >}} The Baker Hill farm stand is proud to offer its vegetables for sale now.

---

- >{{< fa times >}} The Sonic's best player is Ubaldo Jimenez.

- >{{< fa check >}} The Sonics' best player is Ubaldo Jimenez.


### 14. It's / Its error

**It's** is a contraction and means "it is" or "it has." **Its** is
the possessive form of it:

- >{{< fa times >}} Its unfair to make him pay for all the damages.

- >{{< fa check >}} It's unfair to make him pay for all the damages.


### 15. Fused (run-on) sentence

A fused sentence is also known as a "run-on" sentence. It occurs when two clauses that could stand alone as complete sentences are placed together without punctuation:

- >{{< fa times >}} Jeff was Wisconsin's greatest dog trainer he could make a canine do virtually anything.

- >{{< fa check >}} Jeff was Wisconsin's greatest dog trainer; he could make a canine do virtually anything.


### 16. Comma splice

- >{{< fa times >}} Dinosaurs once ruled the valley, they are all gone now.

- >{{< fa check >}} Dinosaurs once ruled the valley, but they are all gone now.

- >{{< fa check >}} Dinosaurs once ruled the valley; they are all gone now.

A comma splice occurs when two independent clauses are joined by a comma. To revise, use a comma with a coordinating conjunction or a semicolon.

### 17. Capitalization error

{{< figure src="/img/capitalization-error.png" >}}

### 18. Poorly integrated quotation

Integrating quotations is challenging for most students. It is often the cause of grammatical or syntactical errors. When you integrate borrowed material into your own writing, the "hybrid" sentence you create must satisfy grammar and avoid awkward or repetitive phrasing:

- >{{< fa times >}} Scholar Rod Andrews argues "I argue that there can be no reasonable discussions of Shakespeare's biography" (99).

- >{{< fa check >}} Scholar Rod Andrews argues that "there can be no reasonable discussions of Shakespeare's biography" (99).



### 19. Unnecessary or missing hyphen

- >{{< fa times >}} He bought a nineteenth century painting.

- >{{< fa check >}} He bought a nineteenth-century painting.

----

- >{{< fa times >}} His high-school was one of the best in the state.

- >{{< fa check >}} His high school was one of the best in the state.

### 20. Sentence fragment

A fragment is an incomplete thought. It is a dependent clause treated as an independent one.

- >{{< fa times >}} This school offers many classes. Such as Accounting and English.

- >{{< fa check >}}This school offers many classes, such as Accounting and English.

## Topic Sentences 

`Topic sentences` function like a miniature `thesis` that communicates the purpose or main idea of a paragraph. It is important that your topic sentences are clear and accurately reflect the nature of the paragraph it initiates.

Most commonly, topic sentences are strong, declarative statements that make a `claim`. The sentences that follow the topic sentence in the paragraph are used to support that claim. However, a topic sentence may also be a question. In this case, the sentences that follow the topic sentence are used to move toward a conclusion or further develop the question.

### <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Some generally good advice about topic sentences:

1. Use the topic sentence of each paragraph to clearly state the subject or focus of the paragraph. If the paragraph and topic sentence are not in sync, or if the topic sentence doesn't actually state the nature of the paragraph, you need to revise it.

2. Use the topic sentence to set forth a `claim` that supports the thesis and drives the argument forward. This is not a hard rule, and there are other ways to start a paragraph, but it is a strong way that helps keep you focused.

Compare:

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> My high school has a unique program that allowed students to experiment and explore. 

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> Education facilitates inquiry and exploration, which are critical needs in the life of every human being.

More information on topic sentences, including examples, here in the [*Open Handbook*](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-7). 

---

## Paragraphs 

### <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Some generally good advice about paragraphs:

Paragraphs should be *unified*: every sentence in the paragraph should focus in some way on the main idea expressed in the `topic sentence`. Further, the paragraph’s individual sentences should be presented in a logical order and flow naturally from one to the other. While this is not a strict rule, it may be helpful to think of paragraphs as miniature essays, each with their own thesis, development, and proof.

{{< details "Everyday vs. Every day" >}}
#

In the first draft I saw many students who were confused about **everyday** (as one word) and **every day** (as two words). They are very different in their meanings:


- <span style="color: var(--circle-dots)"><i class="far fa-dot-circle"></i></span> **everyday**: *adj*. As one word you use it to mean that something is *ordinary* or *common*. In fact, just substitute one of those words in place of everyday to see if the sentence still makes sense. 

- <span style="color: var(--circle-dots)"><i class="far fa-dot-circle"></i></span> **every day** *adv*. As two words it is an adverbial phrase that means "each day" or "daily," a reference to the frequency of a certain action.


---

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> My son eats oatmeal everyday. 

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> My son eats oatmeal every day.


---

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> The everyday struggles of many Americans are truly heartbreaking.

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> The every day struggles of many Americans are truly heartbreaking.

---

## The <i class="fas fa-bomb"></i> F-bomb solution™

For no particular reason I have discovered that if you can put an f-bomb between **every** and **day** then it should be *two words*:

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span>  I go to the store every [f*ing] day. 

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> These are my every [f*ing] day pants.

A clever way to remember this:

+ Every <i class="fas fa-bomb"></i> day (See the space? An F-bomb fits in there. Two words.)

+ Everyday (No space for the bomb. One word.)

{{< details "Comma Splices and Semicolons" >}}
#

### Semicolons

**A. Used to separate a series of items containing commas.** (Not very common).

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> I went to London, England, Paris, France, Bristol, Tennessee, and Berlin, Germany. 

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> I went to London, England; Paris, France; Bristol, Tennessee; and Berlin, Germany. 

**B.  Used to link two independent clauses to suggest a connection.** (Very common).

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> My son had trouble sleeping last night; I shouldn't have given him that chocolate cupcake.

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> Americans say they appreciate the hard work of teachers; however, very few are willing to pay them a decent wage. 

**C.  Things you don't do with semicolons**.

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> Please get three things from the store; bread, milk, and a *lot* of beer.

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> Please get three things from the store: bread, milk, and a *lot* of beer.  

### Comma splice errors

A comma splice error occurs when you use a comma to connect two independent clauses: 

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> I love my red truck, it is a Chevy Colorado. 

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> I love my red truck. It is a Chevy Colorado. 

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> I love my red truck; it is a Chevy Colorado.

{{< details "The Em Dash — " >}}

#

The **em dash** is perhaps the most versatile punctuation mark: it can function like a comma, colon, or parentheses. In formal writing it is used to indicate extra information or an aside---much as you would do with commas, colons, or parentheses. There is a good explainer on this punctuation mark on the [Merriam-Webster site](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/em-dash-en-dash-how-to-use). The two most common uses in formal writing are displayed here:

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> The Soviets gave us the greatest exercise tool ever invented - the kettlebell. 
- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> The Soviets gave us the greatest exercise tool ever invented—the kettlebell. 

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> The Soviet-Afghan War---a main contributor to the fall of the Soviet Union---has received increased scrutiny by scholars as America's mission there has foundered.

How do you show emphasis in formal writing?

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> Unless I am being unusually calculating, I don't DECIDE to befriend someone . . . 

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> Unless I am being unusually calculating, I don't **decide** to befriend someone . . .

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> Unless I am being unusually calculating, I don't *decide* to befriend someone . . .

{{< details "The 5 Paragraph Essay" >}}

#

Everyone was taught the 5-paragraph essay form in high school. There is an introduction with a thesis, three paragraphs of support, and a summary conclusion that restates the thesis. 

The problem is that you can't really do much in 5-paragraphs and your time at Dartmouth will require you to reach for rhetorical forms that can accommodate much more complexity. One place to begin is to imagine that your paper is as many paragraphs as needed in order to justify the thesis. There is no magic number of paragraphs. There is no recipe or formula. 

Another thing to reconsider is the `summary conclusion` that is a hallmark of the 5-paragraph essay. I saw many of these. You say what you've just said again at the end. Strong readers might find this somewhat insulting since it assumes we can't understand what we just read or hold these ideas in our heads for 5 paragraphs. 

If we imagine that the reader has a good grasp on what you've just argued, how should your piece end? What do you need to say or do or explain to achieve closure? What do you hope the reader takes away from your argument? What should they do in response to it?
