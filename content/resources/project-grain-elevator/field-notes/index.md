> Another value of field notebooks is their ability to serve as an incredibly fertile incubator for your ideas and observations. By jotting down interesting observations, questions, and miscellaneous ideas, your field notebook can serve as a powerful catalyst for new experiments and projects.

> Our notes should, indeed, be useful for purposes of review; yet that usefulness is not their chief value. . . . The practical value of our notes will take care of itself as a matter of secondary importance, if we devote ourselves wholly to their main purpose—to make us alert, clear-headed, and responsible . . . . To take good notes is not preliminary to study, but study itself of the most vital kind; calling at once on all one's powers of concentration, judgment, and craftsmanship.

> I will describe here a special kind of journal which I call a dialectical notebook. I like to remind myself (and others) that dialectic and dialogue are closely related; that thinking is a dialogue we have with ourselves; that dialectic is an audit of meaning—a continuing effort to review the meanings we are making in order to see further what they mean. The means we have of doing that are—meanings. The dialectical notebook keeps all our meanings handy. Here is how it works: the dialectical notebook is a double-entry journal with the two pages facing one another in dialogue. On one side are observations, sketches, noted impressions, passages copied out, jottings on reading or other responses; on the facing page are notes on these notes, responses to these responses—in current jargon, “meta-comment.” The first thing the dialectical notebook can teach us is toleration of those necessary circularities. Everything about language, everything in composing, involves us in them: thinking about thinking; arranging our techniques for arranging; interpreting our interpretations.

> Thoughts one achieves in one’s final draft cannot be articulated at first. They are only reached via a series of intermediate externalized thoughts. Paper can be like a conversation partner, but with the enhancement that the words do not dissolve into the air. What is written can also be taken up by someone else who does, as it were, the backward translation of words into mental models within which he or she can think. In this way, thought can be passed from mind to mind. Also the writer can be the reader, can replay an externalized thought in language form back to himself or herself, and take part in the iterated movement by which thoughts can be improved.

## What are field notes?

### In this class, *the field notes are the work* . . .

[Field notebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fieldnotes) have been used by explorers and scientists for centuries to aid in observation, reflection, and preservation. They are records of human attempts to know and understand: chronicles of adventure and discovery in unexplored territories, descriptions of radical otherness and cultural difference, narratives of danger and fear, stories of deeply personal change and evolution. They are also jottings of the most mundane sort: ordinary facts, passing thoughts, offhanded queries, bits of data, placeholders for further study—even a [weird fantasy about a little bird that keeps repeatedly building a nest on your house](/img/birdngun.jpg). We will use the conceit of entering the field as a way of understanding our work together in this class. I like how the metaphor of fieldwork conjures scenes of exploration, discovery, danger, and transformation—experiences that I have come to associate with education and the work of learning.

### Observation
*The field notebook is a technology of observation and intentional curiosity.* Each time we enter the field of inquiry, we will record our findings. Much like a naturalist or sociologist uses a field notebook to document the intricate details of their surroundings, we will use our notebooks to record our observations, ideas, and responses. By copying out bits of text that seem important to us, and by jotting down spontaneous thoughts, insights, and questions as we have them, we can harness our innate curiosity and transform it into a more structured exploration. For the most part, we should practice what is known as [grounded theory](https://pressbooks.rampages.us/sociology-research-methods/chapter/9-2-going-into-the-field/#return-footnote-1325-1), an approach tipified by an "open-ended and open-minded desire to understand . . . letting the data guide [us] rather than guiding the data with a set of hypotheses in mind."
### Reflection
*The field notebook is a tool for reflection.* When we preserve an artifact, idea, or question in our field notes, it becomes available for future reflection, analysis, connection. Revisiting these notes allows us to engage in a continuous process of re-evaluation and refinement, incorporating new insights and information as they arise by entering into a dialogue with our previous entries. This iterative approach facilitates deeper understanding, allowing us to reassess our initial interpretations and adapt our ideas in light of new perspectives or evidence. The field notebook thus becomes a space for experimentation, for viewing matters different perspectives, for solving complex problems, and for slowly accreting ideas and evidence until they form arguments we believe in. By regularly returning to our field notes, we will engage in a systematic process of idea development, enhancing our ability to think critically and adapting our writing based on an ongoing process of discovery and reflection. 

### Writing Process
*Field notes are an essential intermediary step in the process of writing.* Some compelling cognitive science research shows the critical importance of these sorts of records as preparation for future, more formal, writing. Notes such as these essentially accomplish the "freezing" of thoughts, ideas, or selected text passages which helps us deal with the central problem of writing: cognitive overload. Since our brains cannot hold the entirety of an argument or the full text of something we are working on, the encoding of these thoughts on the page frees up our brains to perform other, higher-level cognitive tasks. We can leave, return, connect, and reevaluate ideas and texts only once they are manifested on the page. 

### Staying in Touch
*The field notebook is a way of staying in touch with who we used to be.* While field notebooks are an aid for exploring the external world, they may also be used to perform an archeology of the self. We may choose to preserve experiences or thoughts that are not strictly concerned with our coursework—recordings of everyday events and facts about our lives. We might a song lyric, a dream, the encouraging words of a friend that we'd like to hold onto. Or we may choose to make entries on a personal struggle or record a feeling of loss or a disappointment that shattered us. Sometimes we are not even sure why we collect certain things in the moment, much as we might have the sudden urge to save a pebble from a stream and place it wet and glistening into our pocket. Why might we do this sort of collecting? In her essay "[On Keeping a Notebook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slouching_Towards_Bethlehem)," Joan Didion says that ultimately she keeps a notebook to "Remember what it was to be me: that is always the point." Years from now, you will have forgotten nearly all of your experiences in college; all that will remain is a blur of faces, some embellished stories, and perhaps a handful of regrets. Unless, of course, you take the time to save some pebbles now. 

### Mental Health Benefits
There is [some very compelling research](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/style/journaling-benefits.html) that personal journal writing is a potent weapon against depression and helps achieve a more mindful aproach to our lives.

*The field notebook is a powerful technology of observation and intentional curiosity*. Much like a naturalist uses a field notebook to document the intricate details of their surroundings, we will use our notebooks to record our observations, ideas, and responses as we work in fields of inquiry. By copying out bits of text that seemed important to us, and by jotting down spontaneous thoughts, insights, and questions as we have them, we can harness our innate curiosity and transform it into a more structured exploration. In this class we will practice writing as tool for slow looking—as a form of meditation and close analysis.  

When we describe a thing with our own words (or sketch its outline in a drawing) we enter an intensifed mode of observation, a cognitive downshift that opens us and readies us for learning. As we endeavor to faithfully describe or represent a thing, we begin to truly *see* it, not merely look at it. Embracing this process of slow looking reveals that our habitual ways of seeing are actually a form of blindness: our mental concepts and schema are shorthands that replace perception and obscure our vision at every turn. If you try this yourself, by looking and looking (and looking again) at some ordinary object, taking note of what you see, you will begin to understand just how much escapes our initial, cursory glance. Whole worlds open in this way. In this class we will practice writing as tool for slow looking—as a form of meditation and close analysis.

We can leave, return, connect, and reevaluate ideas and texts only once they are manifested on the page. Our field notes will become notes on notes, comments on comments, thoughts about thinking. This is the fertile swamp from which a complex idea evolves. We preserve these things in some form because we are liable to forget and they may be of great use to us later. When we fail to do so, these moments, ideas, dreams, questions, passing thoughts and bright ideas fade from memory, often irrevocably. Sometimes we are not even sure why we collect things in the moment, much as we might have the sudden urge to save a pebble from a stream and place it wet and glistening into our pocket. 

*The field notebook is a way of staying in touch with who we used to be.* We may preserve an artifact merely because it was beautiful: a quotation, a sketch we made of a leaf, a photograph, a memorable turn of phrase. Perhaps we save other things because we imagine that they will be useful to us later. Sometimes we are not even sure why we collect certain things in the moment, much as we might have the sudden urge to save a pebble from a stream and place it wet and glistening into our pocket. In her essay "On Keeping a Notebook," Joan Didion says that ultimately she keeps a notebook to "Remember what it was to be me: that is always the point." Years from now, you will have forgotten nearly all of your experiences in college; all that will remain is a blur of faces, some embellished and half-true stories, and perhaps a handful of regrets. Unless you take the time to save some pebbles now. 

This is the fertile swamp from which a complex idea evolves. Sometimes we are not even sure why we collect certain things in the moment, much as we might have the sudden urge to save a pebble from a stream and place it wet and glistening into our pocket. We'll preserve artifacts that seem important to us at the time, like pebbles we feel suddenly compelled to save from a river. And we will try to explain to ourselves why we decided to save this one thing from oblivion. Why preserve these "bits of the mind's string too short to use?" as Joan Didion once wrote.  Hopefully, the answer is not "To do well in this class" and more what Joan Didion said about keeping a notebook: "Remember what it was to be me: that is always the point."

I think we are well advised to keep on nodding terms with the people we used to be whether we find them attractive company or not. Otherwise they turn up unannounced and surprise us, come hammering on the mind’s door at 4 a.m. of a bad night and demand to know who deserted them, who betrayed them, who is going to make amends. We forget all too soon the things we thought we could never forget. We forget the loves and the betrayals alike, forget what we whispered and what we screamed, forget who we were. I have already lost touch with a couple of people I used to be . . . . It is a good idea, then, to keep in touch, and I suppose that keeping in touch is what notebooks are all about.

We will be auditors of meaning. An audit of meaning. A snapshot of our mind in time. A documentation of change. As Shari Tishman writes in her book *Slow Looking*, "Description is an ongoing act of observation, not just a tidy report of a prior internal mental state" (16). And the records made within the field notes ensure our observations will not be lost to oblivion and instead be available to us for future reflection and analysis. In this course, the field notes are the work. The thinking, observing, analyzing, planning, responding, questioning, and drafting of the course will happen within these notebooks.

Formalized curiosity, intentional curiosity. Really *seeing,* not just looking. Didion: "bits of the mind’s string too short to use"

We are all collectors. Along our way in this life we gather skills, ideas, bits of wisdom: from George Washington's false teeth, to Avogadro's number, to tips on avoiding hangovers. We also think about more pressing and more interesting matters: What does it mean to be human? What is justice? Why do I believe as I do? Our whole life, our entire education, is a long process of making such discoveries and contemplating such ponderous questions. If we are intelligent, we preserve these things in some way because we are liable to forget and they may be useful to us later. When we fail to preserve them, these moments, ideas, dreams, questions, passing thoughts and bright ideas fade from memory, often irrevocably. We tend to forget things that we try to retain in our heads, so it is often best to memorialize our prizes in some form: an external brain like a notebook or a computer file. 

We may preserve an artifact merely because it was beautiful: a quotation, a sketch we made of a leaf, a photograph, a memorable turn of phrase. Perhaps we save other things because we imagine that they will be useful to us later. Sometimes we are not even sure why we collect certain things in the moment, much as we might have the sudden urge to save a pebble from a stream and place it wet and glistening into our pocket.

This term we'll be keeping all of our course notes, thinking, inquiry, and planning ideas inside a notebook—likely a series of them. People sometimes refer to these texts as "[commonplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book)" books. These books have been kept since antiquity and are a way "to compile knowledge" by constructing entry notes of various kinds including quotations, notes, sketches, plans, etc. When you think of this class, of the work of this class, I want you to think of your field notes. When you have an idea, a passing thought, when you discover an interesting quotation from a reading, when you detect a connection between our class and something outside of it, when you create an outline for your upcoming draft or receive some good advice from our teaching assistant: I want you to put it in this book.
