Our field-records will be perhaps the most valuable of all our results; hence the importance of a convenient system of record.

--- [Joseph Grinnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Grinnell#Grinnell_Method_of_note_taking), 1908


Another value of field notebooks is their ability to serve as an incredibly fertile incubator for your ideas and observations. By jotting down interesting observations, questions, and miscellaneous ideas, your field notebook can serve as a powerful catalyst for new experiments and projects."  (258)


"Through the process of assembling this list, two main guiding principles have emerged: First, you will forget things far faster than you expect—most people think they will
remember details of their observations and studies for longer and better than they actually do; and second, you will not know at the beginning of a study all the things that might be important or interesting—for this reason, it is a great idea to record more information than you think you might need."

--- Erick Greene, "Why Keep a Field Notebook?"

"Anyone concerned with working out ideas . . . must be a writer, because writing provides the readiest means of carrying out what I.A. Richards calls an audit of meaning."

--- Ann Berthoff, "Dialectical Notebooks and the Audit of Meaning"

`Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English); `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was! Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off).

# Field Notes

The field notes are the work. 

The central enterprise and metaphor for this course is the [field note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fieldnotes).

We are all collectors. Along our way we gather skills, ideas, bits of wisdom, tips on avoiding hangovers. Our whole life, and our entire education, is a long process of making such discoveries. If we are intelligent, we preserve these things because they may be useful to us later. We tend to forget things that we try to retain in our heads, so it is often best to memorialize our prizes in some form: an external brain like a notebook or a computer file. 

We may preserve an artifact merely because it was beautiful: a poem, a sketch we made of a leaf, a photograph, a memorable turn of phrase. Perhaps we save other things because we imagine that they will be useful to us later. Sometimes we are not even sure why we collect certain things in the moment, much as we might have the sudden urge to save a pebble from a stream and place it in our pocket.

This term we'll be keeping all of our course notes, thinking, inquiry, and planning ideas inside a notebook—likely a series of them. People sometimes refer to these texts as "[commonplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book)" books. These books have been kept since antiquity and are a way "to compile knowledge" by constructing entry notes of various kinds including quotations, notes, sketches, plans, etc. When you think of this class, of the work of this class, I want you to think of your field notes. When you have an idea, a passing thought, when you discover an interesting quotation from a reading, when you detect a connection between our class and something outside of it, when you create an outline for your upcoming draft or receive some good advice from our teaching assistant: I want you to put it in this book. 

*The field notes are the work of this class*. 


## Constructing the Field Note

- Begin each new notebook with a running index, like the one pictured above. Always include a two-page spread for new vocabulary and concepts.
- Number each page in the top right corner for ease of reference.
- Begin an entry with a timestamp. Use the following `YYYYMMDD`, or **20141028**.
