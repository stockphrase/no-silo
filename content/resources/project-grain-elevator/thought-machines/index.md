# Thought Machines

Thought machines are simple mechanisms designed to help us think. Some provoke our thinking by directing our attention to texts or artifacts in certain specific ways. This priming might function as a sort of lens by narrowing our focus on certain features that had previously escaped our view. In other cases, we might seek to broaden our understanding with a more systematic approach that tries to bring a wider, more comprehensive, scope to our analysis. And while these tools may be used on written texts, many of them are useful for examining other cultural artifacts such as film, music, or art.

Each of these machines represent practices that are used by effective writers and researchers. More practiced writers make use of these tools routinely, in concert, and without much conscious thought. However, breaking them into discrete tools for practice and experimentation is often a very helpful way to learn deeper forms of analysis and critical thinking.

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"></font></i> 1) LIST ALL ARGUMENTS:</p>

---

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> Identify the key arguments made in the reading. As I describe elsewhere, you should get into the habit of flagging arguments in texts as a process of critical <a href="https://no-silo.com/resources/open-handbook/chapter-1/">annotation</a>. You might choose a symbol to place in the margins of readings to identify arguments as you encounter them. I use a small circle or dot, like this: <span style="color: var(--readings)"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle"></i></span>. Sometimes I put a symbol in the circle like a question mark <span style="color: var(--readings)"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-question"></i></span> or an exclamation point <span style="color: var(--readings)"><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-exclamation"></i></span> to indicate what I was thinking about the argument as I read it at the time. Do whatever works for you, but remember the idea is that this is a clue for your future self. Make life easy for future self. One of the main skills required here is the ability to distinguish argumentative statements from the things that support them: like examples, metaphors, and evidence. In your field notebook, make a series of numbered statements that summarize each of the supporting arguments that you detect in the text. Essentially, construct a brief and precise outline of the text's thesis and various supporting arguments.</p>

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> 2) SUMMARY: </p>

---

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> A summary is a concise re-presentation of the essential features of a text. The summary should not be list-like; it should be a confident presentation with a nice flow and logic. Although a summary sacrifices specificity and detail in the interest of brevity, it must always remain a faithful representation of the original text. Write a tight summary of the entire argument; use <u>LIST ALL ARGUMENTS</u> as your guide. Don’t leave anything out. Don't add anything that isn't there. No opinions or evaluations. Just the facts, stated clearly. </p>

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> 3) QUICK RESPONSE: </p>

---

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> What part(s) of this essay gave you pause? Made you curious about something? Did it inspire some thought related or adjacent to its arguments? Were there references to persons or texts or ideas that you are unfamiliar with? Pick something particular and explain what the esssay inspired for you personally. Dig into these things: do some research or some writing about this. While the response genre will be personal in nature, it should not be without substance. For example, it isn't enough to say "I liked it" or "This was no good."</p>

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> 4) QUICK ARGUMENT: </p> 

---

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> Find a particular argument within the essay and make an argument of your own about it. Is the writer wrong about something? What is your reasoning for disagreeing? Perhaps you have an idea about how this idea could be extended to something else that the author doesn't discuss? Or you might explore the implications of some idea or argument that the author does not pursue. If you agree with the author's thinking, should we do something concrete or change something particular in our lives based on the implications of the argument? </p>

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> 5) CLOSE READING: </p>

---

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> A passage means what it says because the author arranged a series of words together in such a way as to produce that meaning. However, once the writing is complete and the text is out in the world, it becomes subject to interpretation by audiences. We sometimes call these interpretations ‘readings.’ A ‘close reading’ is a decoding exercise, a detailed explanation of exactly what a passage means (according to us) <b>using only the words in the text</b> as evidence. What do you think this passage from the text means? What evidence in the text supports your view? How far can you take the analysis? You might discover a deeper interpretation if you look up certain words in the dictionary and find less common senses of the word. You might notice the way a metaphor suggests a certain perspective on the passage or how it connects to some other theme or idea in the broader text. Write an explanation of all this thinking to your audience. A close reading should not be impressionistic (‘This writing sucks!’ or ‘I love it!’); or evaluative (‘This idea is important’); instead, it should focus on simply explaining to your audience what the passage means by meticulously pointing to how the text is constructed. </p>

---

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> What are the key moments in the text? These will no doubt include moments where key arguments are made; however, it may also just include certain terms, turns of phrase, or memorable language that seems to invite quotation in our own writing. Imagine that you are stripping the argument for parts so that you can use them for something you are building. What are the essential, necessary items that you need to extract?</p>

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> 10) RHETORICAL ANALYSIS: </p>

---

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> Examine how the author chose to present their ideas, knowing that they could have chosen differently. For example, one author might write a traditional argument while another may choose to tell a story. A writer might be furious, mocking, sarcastic; or, they may take the "high road" and try to win the audience with a high-minded and respectful form of discourse. Were these choices effective for you personally as a reader? What about for a broader, or different, audience?</p>

---

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> Write down a ‘big idea’ that you had today in class. This could be something someone said, an idea from a reading, or something you thought. Perhaps this idea might relate to some of your own writing in the class. Or relate to something more personal for you. This thought might be useful later, so memorialize it.</p>

---

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> All good writers are thieves. During your peer review, did you see something that you admired in the other student's draft?

---

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> Things have parts; these parts work together to form a broader system. A car engine, a laptop computer, a riparian ecosysem. When we take inventory, we try to take notice of all of the parts that make up a thing by first isolating them and then inquiring into their purpose within the broader complexity or system. Many of these things are not apparent upon first glance and require patience, effort, and imagination. Examine a paragraph, analyzing each word, each sentence, in the broader context of the paragraph. How do they function? What is their purpose? How do the contribute to the overal design or meaning? Look at an argument as a whole. Examine each paragraph. What is this part doing here? What purpose does it serve in the broader text or argument? How does it connect, mesh, complicate, engage, or trouble other aspects of the text? Does the text emerge from a broader system, like an existing dialogue or conversation? </p>

---

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/indagate">Indigate</a> is an uncommon term that comes into English from the Latin verb <i>indagare</i>, which suggests a hunter tracking game. I like this word better than the more common "investigate," since it suggests work in the field and encounters with wildness, the unknown, danger. Find some small reference in the text that you are unfamilliar with. Perhaps it is a reference to a person, some place, a group of people, or some other thing that is unexplained in the text. Find something that you are curious about. Track down the reference and write a paragraph or two about what you find after you have captured your prey. How does this thing relate to the broader text or argument? How does this new knowledge relate to the text? What meaning(s) does it unlock? </p>
