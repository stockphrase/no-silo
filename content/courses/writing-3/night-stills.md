# Stills from *Night of the Living Dead* (1968)

- [Review of *Night of the Living Dead*](https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-night-of-the-living-dead-1968) by film critic Roger Ebert (1969):

> "The kids in the audience were stunned. There was almost complete silence. The movie had stopped being delightfully scary about halfway through, and had become unexpectedly terrifying. There was a little girl across the aisle from me, maybe nine years old, who was sitting very still in her seat and crying."

Since prehistoric times humans have imagined monsters. Scholars have determined that all cultures produce fantastic creatures that inspire fear or dread. But why is this so? What purpose
do they serve? Significantly, the etymology of the word itself provides clues: the English word
‚Äúmonster‚Äù comes from the Latin *monstrum*, which means to ‚Äúreveal‚Äù or to ‚Äúwarn.‚Äù What do our
monsters reveal to us? What do they warn us about? And what does it signify about our culture when these monsters change or evolve? Without question, the most popular monster of the past decade is the zombie---a creature whose most salient characteristic is a mindless and insatiable cannibalistic drive. Many scholars argue that the widespread fear of cannibalism emerges
during periods when distinct cultures encounter each other for the first time---such as during exploration, colonialism, or warfare. This experience of otherness registers as a threat to cultural integrity and personal identity which, in turn, is projected upon the "Other".

Will Brown was lynched by a white vigilante mob in September of 1919 in Omaha, NE. He was riddled with bullets, hanged, dragged behind a car, and ultimately burned.[^1] This is just one of thousands of lynchings that took place all over the country between the end of the Civil War and 1950.[^2]
