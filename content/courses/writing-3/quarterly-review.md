5. Did you give your best effort on each assignment?
6. How much of the reading did you complete?
7. Did you watch all of the films and prepare for discussion?
8. How much did you contribute to Hive? Was this your best effort at sharing/helping others?
9. How often did you contribute on discussion days? Could you have contributed more to the conversation?
