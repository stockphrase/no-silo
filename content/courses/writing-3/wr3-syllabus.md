{{< /hint >}} 


Why do we feel such an attraction to disaster? Why do we produce novels, films, and other forms of art that contemplate the end of humanity? Scholars from many disciplines have offered theories about the appeal and meaning of
such spectacles of apocalyptic destruction. We will read some of this critical literature, examining views from disciplines such as psychology, sociology, cultural studies, and religion. In addition to these assigned readings, each of you
will engage in your own original process of inquiry on a related topic of your choosing. You will present your findings
frequently to the community of scholars in our class, sharing and discussing your research discoveries and insights.
Ultimately, you will produce a lengthy work of original scholarship that will contribute to this field of inquiry.
