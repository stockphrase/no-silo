# Post-apocalyptic Fiction, Film, and Art

> "Apocalypse, we propose, is never a locatable event but rather an imaginative practice that forms and deforms history for specific purposes: an aesthetic that does as much as it represents. Apocalyptic art may represent an imagined future, but it acts in and upon the present" (451).
>
> — Hessica Hurley and Dan Sinykin, ["Apocalypse: Introduction"](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/711828)

## Course Description
Why do we feel such an attraction to disaster? Why do we produce novels, films, and other forms of art that contemplate the end of humanity? Scholars from many disciplines have offered theories about the appeal and meaning of such spectacles of apocalyptic destruction. We will read some of this critical literature, examining views from disciplines such as psychology, sociology, cultural studies, and religion. In addition to these assigned readings, each of you will engage in your own original process of inquiry on a related topic of your choosing. You will present your findings frequently to the community of scholars in our class, sharing and discussing your research discoveries and insights. Ultimately, you will produce a lengthy work of original scholarship that will contribute to this field of inquiry.

{{< details "Tips on Surviving the NH Winter" >}}

If you hail from a more temperate climate, then you are in for something completely different this term in [Climate Zone 5a](https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/). Here's my hard-won advice on some things that will make your time here more enjoyable and safe:

---

#### <span style="color: var(--tears)"><i class="fa-solid fa-snowflake"></i></span> A good coat

You probably think you have a solid winter coat. But if you are from a climate like California or Texas, you probably don't. You need something *serious*—a coat insulated with goose down or its synthetic equivalent. Find something that is rated to negative temperatures. The coat should also be windproof or you are just wasting your time. A good rule of thumb: if the coat is [puffy](/img/puffy3.jpeg) and [ugly](/img/puffy4.png), then it's warm. 

---

#### <span style="color: var(--tears)"><i class="fa-solid fa-snowflake"></i></span> Mittens
Gloves are for rookies and chumps. What you need are a really good pair of *mittens*. Your fingers need to stay close together like a happy family to keep warm. Get something insulated and waterproof.

---

#### <span style="color: var(--tears)"><i class="fa-solid fa-snowflake"></i></span> Insulating layers
If you plan to stay outside for an extended length of time, you should look into some insulating layers (aka: thermal underwear). This stuff will make you bulletproof.

---

#### <span style="color: var(--tears)"><i class="fa-solid fa-snowflake"></i></span> Face covering
When it is 10°F and the wind is howling, your uncovered face will get utterly destroyed. Get a neck gaiter that you can pull up over your mouth and nose to keep your face from getting lashed by the winds on these brutal days. 

---

#### <span style="color: var(--tears)"><i class="fa-solid fa-snowflake"></i></span> Snow boots

You are going to have to walk though snow and slush during winter and sloppy mud in the spring. Sometimes it is pretty deep. You need some waterproof muck boots that are at least mid length for bad days. Look, there's no way to avoid this: these are ugly and utilitarian. But if you try to remain a fashion plate, you are going to really pay for it by ruining your good shoes and getting frozen toes. These boots also need to have a really aggressive tread on them. Otherwise, you are going to slip and fall down a lot. Everyone seems to think that the iconic [Bean Boot <i class="fa-solid fa-shoe-prints"></i>](https://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/506697?page=llbean-boots) is the answer. These people are very wrong. 

---

#### <span style="color: var(--tears)"><i class="fa-solid fa-snowflake"></i></span> Spikes / Crampons

Often we get an ice storm or ice-forming conditions in Hanover. On these occasions it is not just dangerous but *impossible* to walk around on the sidewalks and streets. Even the best snow boots won't save you in these conditions. On these days you need a pair of spikes. I've tried most of the products on the market. The best by far are made by Khtoola. This company makes serious mountaineering gear, but for everyday use, their [EXOspikes](https://kahtoola.com/traction/exospikes-footwear-traction/) will take excellent care of you. I've waked on solid ice for miles with these and never even slipped. These fit over your boots or shoes and provide four-wheel drive for your feet. Get a size up from your normal shoe size if you plan to wear these on big snow boots.

---

#### <span style="color: var(--tears)"><i class="fa-solid fa-snowflake"></i></span> Vitamin D3

Your body [synthesizes vitamin D when sunlight is absorbed by your skin](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-HealthProfessional). However, during the dark winter months we mostly stay indoors, which can lead to low levels of this important hormone. Without enough vitamin D you may experience a medical condition called SAD, or [Seasonal Affective Disorder](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/seasonal-affective-disorder#:~:text=the%20FDA%20website%20.-,Vitamin%20D,can%20interact%20with%20some%20medications), which gives you symptoms indistinguishable from depression: hopelessness, sadness, loss of interest in activities, difficulty concentrating, etc. Buy a big bottle of vitamin D3 and take it daily during the winter months. There's a lot of snake oil out there in the world of supplements, so buy a name-brand product. I use [Nature Made D3](https://www.naturemade.com/products/vitamin-d3-50-mcg-2000-iu-softgels).

---

#### <span style="color: var(--tears)"><i class="fa-solid fa-snowflake"></i></span> Light Therapy
Consider purchasing a [light therapy lamp](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Light+Therapy+Lamp) to regulate your circadian rhythm and boost mood during the darker months. Use the lamp *during the early daytime hours* only and follow this advice from the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seasonal-affective-disorder/in-depth/seasonal-affective-disorder-treatment/art-20048298). You can get a decent light box for around $20. 

---

#### <span style="color: var(--tears)"><i class="fa-solid fa-snowflake"></i></span> Skin Care
You are going to experience really dry skin. Especially your hands. I have tried everything and have found the greatest product of all time: [CeraVe Healing Ointment](https://www.cerave.com/skincare/moisturizers/healing-ointment). This stuff is the ~~bomb~~ balm. Winter laughs at Jergens. 

---

#### <span style="color: var(--tears)"><i class="fa-solid fa-snowflake"></i></span> Humidifier
The winter air is extremely dry. In extreme cases you will start getting nosebleeds. Get a cheap humidifier for your room and run it at night to get some moisture back in your life. Or you could fill shallow pans with water and put them on top of your radiator for a similar effect.

## Course Objectives

Writing 3 continues our focus on inquiry, critical thinking, and argumentation. The course additionally involves an introduction to academic research. Our libraries hold an
impressive collection of traditional and electronic research tools as well as hundreds of thousands of books, journal
articles, and assorted media. Navigating this ocean of information can be intimidating; however, excellent research
skills are fundamental to your academic training. Therefore, we will spend a significant amount of time learning how to perform academic research and use our library resources effectively. By the end of this course, you should be able to do
the following:

1. Formulate research questions and keywords that may be used to guide a research process.
2. Discover background information on a topic using reference materials.
3. Locate books, periodicals, and other physical media within library collections.
4. Locate electronic databases and query them with precision.
5. Understand the importance of the process known as “peer review.”
6. Critically evaluate sources for credibility and suitability for research.
7. Use bibliographic software and a research journal to track and manage references.
8. Craft a lengthy argument that contributes to an ongoing critical conversation.

{{< details "Some Thoughts on Generative AI and Writing" >}}

While Generative AI certainly has a place in many fields and disciplines (and I’m genuinely excited about aspects of it myself), I believe that it is fundamentally in conflict with the goals of the writing classroom.

My sense has always been that the writing classroom is the best place to develop a host of important skills and abilities, including critical thinking, metacritical analysis (thinking about our thinking), information literacy, creativity, communication skills, and various research competencies. 

An overreliance on AI tools to complete tasks that we would normally describe as “thinking” or “analysis” or "research" will have a tremendously negative effect on our development as individuals. If we use these tools merely to get answers, not encourage us to develop understanding or skill; or if we allow them to generate a mere appearance of thought and expression, rather than its substance, then what will become of us? I mean this literally: what will we be? 

It only makes sense to cut corners with an AI tool if we imagine education as a kind of economy rooted in the exchange of educational products that receive compensation in the form of grades. However, this is an impoverished vision of the purpose of education. I am struck by [Lydia Cao and Chris Dede's](https://bpb-us-e1.wpmucdn.com/websites.harvard.edu/dist/a/108/files/2023/08/Cao_Dede_final_8.4.23.pdf) thoughts on this point:

> “An education that is heavily focused on products reduces learning to a transaction, exchanging a product for a grade, rather than providing a transformative human experience. Learning is much more than generating a product; in fact, the essence of learning is in the process – the journey rather than the destination. Learning to write is not primarily about producing a well-structured piece of text but about developing the capacity to organize one’s ideas, connect these to others’ ideas, analyze claims, synthesize insights, and fulfill our fundamental need to communicate with and learn from others.” 

Some of the problems and struggles that come with education are actually things that we shouldn't try to get rid of. [Joshua Thorpe](https://wonkhe.com/blogs/the-real-risk-of-generative-ai-is-a-crisis-of-knowledge/) explains:

>“[AI] tools suddenly make it really easy to do all kinds of things, very quickly, that used to be hard and slow. Many of these things used to be essential to the intrinsic value of university work—planning, decision-making, struggling, searching, assessing sources, grappling with difficult texts, and learning to accept the discomfort of uncertainty. AI tools remove problems. But some of the problems they remove are useful to have and to solve as a human. Students will find it really difficult to distinguish between what problems are good to solve quickly with AI, and which problems are more valuable to solve themselves.” 

I would argue that Thorpe doesn't go quite far enough: not only are many of these problems and difficulties "useful to have and to solve as a human," these struggles are *precisely the things that make us human and allow us to become more humane*. Among the many problems I believe you should solve yourself if you are interested in being intelligent and growing as a human being:

- reading widely,
- interpreting the meaning of texts and other artifacts,
- *[inventio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventio)* (discovering your own arguments and ideas),
- research/inquiry,
- evaluating sources of information,
- planning and organizing writing, 
- drafting writing,
- revising your writing (and evaluating feedback from others on your writing).

AI can disrupt or replace many or all of these processes; the consequences of doing so, however, are exceedingly grim.

## Attendance Policy

Regular attendance is expected. Bracketing religious observance, serious illness, or personal tragedy, **no more than three unexcused absences in a single term will be acceptable for this course**. This policy applies to:

- regular class meetings 
- assigned X hours 
- Tutor meetings

Four or more unexcused absences may result in repercussions ranging from significant reduction in GPA to failure of the course. If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet with me beforehand to discuss appropriate accommodations.

{{< hint note >}} 
<span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></span> | As I mention in the [Health Information & Resources](/courses/writing-3/wr3-syllabus/#span-stylecolor-var--healthi-classfas-fa-virusispan-health-information--resources) section above: if you are very ill, please [don't be a hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pe9JVLEBgcc) by dragging yourself into class to avoid an absence. I prefer that you consider the health of the others in our class and stay home if you have a fever or are possibly contagious. If you experience an illness or other human problem of the sort that exceeds three absences, I will definitely listen and try to work out something with you. Of course, this may not be possible if your emergency is so prolonged that it prevents meaningful participation and commitment to the course. 

{{< /hint  >}} 

## Typical Weekly Workflow

Here is a list of the typical assignments and activities that we will do each week:

1. Before we meet to discuss a reading as a class, each of you should carefully read and critically engage the text on your own---interrogating, analyzing, and questioning the arguments, ideas, and assumptions you discover there. What do *you* see? What do *you* think? 

2. As you read, I ask that you [annotate](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-1/) the text---that is, mark up the text by adding meaningful symbols, marginal notes, and questions on the document itself. <span class="highlight">***Note***: this requires that you print out the text before you begin reading it.</span> Bring this annotated copy of the reading with you to class to help you engage in the group discussion and analysis. 

3. After making your annotations, take [critical notes](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-2/) on the text in your [field notebook](/resources/project-grain-elevator/field-notes/). These notes will be valuable to you later, when you write your essays (and perhaps further off in the future). Bring your field notebook(s) to every class meeting. 

Here are longer, more detailed, descriptions of these three activities:

### 1. Annotating Texts

Rather than use a laptop or tablet to read our course readings, *I ask that you print them out and annotate them as part of your preparations for class*. Annotation refers to the process of marking up a text by adding your own words and symbols to the document itself. There is no right or wrong way to mark up a text, but you should develop a system that you are comfortable with and try to stick with it. These annotations are flags to draw the attention of your future self to certain important features of a text at some later time. One key objective during annotation is to notice a text's structure by flagging its main components---the `thesis,` argumentative `claims,` and pieces of `evidence.` As we try to understand these structural components of a piece of writing, we should also be evaluating and interrogating it. We can use the margins of the text to ask questions, make brief notes, indicate confusion, define unfamiliar terms, and make connections to other texts. This work serves two purposes: first, it helps you maintain a critical focus as you read; second, it helps you later if the text must be used for study or your own writing. If you plan on being successful in college, the ability to rigorously annotate texts is perhaps the most helpful and important skill you can develop.


{{< hint note >}}
<span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></span> | Further advice and caveats about annotation may be found in the ["Annotation and Critical Reading"](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-1/) chapter of the *Open Handbook*.
{{< /hint >}}

---

### 2. Critical Reading Notes

After annotating a text, create an entry in your field notebook and take critical notes. [Recent research](https://sites.udel.edu/victorp/files/2010/11/Psychological-Science-2014-Mueller-0956797614524581-1u0h0yu.pdf) reveals that [taking notes by hand](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-learning-secret-don-t-take-notes-with-a-laptop/) results in a significant boost to attention, [brain activity](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1219945 ), learning, and recall. In short, experiments show that students who take notes by hand are more successful than students who do so on computers. 

I'd like you to give this a try; you may later decide to memorialize these notes in electronic form, either by retyping or scanning to .pdf. Take *detailed* notes on each of our course texts. Since you will write essays about these texts, these notes will be of significant help to you later. Your aims here should be to:

- **Reduce** the entire argument to its bare essentials using paraphrase, summary, and selective quotation---carefully documenting page numbers during this activity.

- **Interrogate** the text by asking questions, raising objections, and making observations.

- **Connect and compare** the reading to other readings or ideas.

- **Define** any unfamiliar terms or references.

- **Link** the text to any outside research you perform.

At the end of this rigorous process you should have a simplified version of the essay as well as a number of critical observations, questions, and ideas that emerged in the process of reading.

{{< hint note >}}
<span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></span> | For more detailed information on the creation and purpose of these notes, read the chapter on ["Critical Notes"](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-1/) in the [*Open Handbook*](/resources/open-handbook/).
{{< /hint >}}

---

### 3. Field Notebook Entries

Your [field notebook](/resources/project-grain-elevator/field-notes/) is a record of your thinking and observations, a chronicle of your attempts to know and understand. It should contain notes, ideas, and questions about our course readings, class discussions, and anything else that seems worth noting and remembering as you explore various fields of inquiry. I like the metaphor of the field notebook as it conjures scenes of exploration, discovery, encounter, excitement, danger. 

*Keep a tight record of your mind's travels*. 

Our objective for the field notebooks is to explore meaning, discover the argumentative structure(s) of our readings, evaluate supporting evidence, ask probing questions, connect to other readings, take notes, plan revision, and think critically. With luck, your notebook will become a central resource in our class discussions and an indispensable aid to you as you craft your essays. I'm providing these notebooks to you; if you fill yours up, just ask for another one.

## Grading

A few years ago I decided to quit grading, mostly as an emergency response to the realities of teaching during the COVID pandemic. Although I didn't know it at the time, a large body of research concludes that grading is not just counterproductive, but actively harmful to the process of education. As [Jesse Stommel writes](https://pressbooks.pub/thegrade/), grades are "not a good measure of learning, they inhibit intrinsic motivation, and they create a competitive environment between students and hostile relationships between students and teachers." Perhaps the foremost scholar on grading, Alfie Kohn, argues that grading produces [three predicable effects](https://muse.jhu.edu/book/78367) in students: "less interest in learning, a preference for easier tasks, and shallower thinking" (xiv). If you think back on your experiences in high school, you may very well discover evidence of these effects in your own life. 

*It doesn't have to be this way*. 

For the reasons described above (and others we will explore together), **this class will not feature traditional letter grades for evaluation**. To be sure, I will give you feedback and encouragement and promise to assist you in any way that I can. I will ask a lot of questions and try to push you to experiment and grow as a writer. You will receive similar feedback from your colleagues in the class. And you will also perform reflective self-evaluations of your writing, thinking, and effort. But at no point will this complex and important work be reduced to a percentage or letter grade. 

At the end of the term we will reflect together on your progress, effort, participation, and performance; we will decide together what final grade to enter into Banner. This discussion about your performance in the class will involve our mutual reflection on the following topics:

- Participation
- Attendance
- Collaboration and sharing
- Late, incomplete, missing work
- Growth
- Effort

{{< hint note >}} 
<span style="color: var(--warning)"><i class="fa-solid fa-star"></i></span> | <span class="highlight"> There is one important caveat. To earn this right (and to pass the course), all assignments must be completed and a solid attendance record must be kept. </span>

{{< /hint >}}

## Major Assignments

### 1. Formal Research Essay

You will write one formal research essay. The project will involve many of the core competencies we developed in the previous term including argumentation, critical thinking, close reading, synthesis, and theoretical analysis. You may write on any topic you wish, so long as it is a contribution to our course conversation and theme. Please discuss your ideas with me before you get too far along. I am happy to meet with each of you to discuss ideas and help formulate a research plan.

{{< hint note >}}
<span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-star-of-life"></i> Essay requirements:</span> 

- The essay must be submitted in the [Chicago format](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-11-chi). 

- It must contain a minimum of 15 [peer-reviewed](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-12/#peer-review) sources. 

- Sources that are not peer-reviewed may also be used. However, be judicious if you do so. 
 
- Your essay should be at least 3,700 words, or about 15 pages in length.
{{< /hint >}}

### 2. Research Workshops

Several workshop assignments will help you gain confidence with using library resources, constructing bibliographies, and managing large research projects.

### 3. Presentations

You will make one formal presentation at the conclusion of the term to explain your research project to our class. You will also make a number of informal presentations about your ideas, research, and writing as they evolve over the term. These informal presentations may not be announced, *so be prepared to discuss your project at any time*.

### 4. Author Page

Each of you will curate a webpage dedicated to your research project. We will call this site your `Author Page`. You may create this page as a shared [Google Doc](https://google.dartmouth.edu/) or use the Dartmouth [Journeys](https://journeys.dartmouth.edu/) platform. After creating your page, link to it on the course [research projects page](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mRHkolo3oVGlIApBqNlCrA0qXQtbigpnkLi2xLuD6OU/edit?usp=drive_link) so that we may locate it. We will use these Author Pages to view your project as it evolves over time. One of your most important responsibilities this term is to keep this page updated. Your author page should contain the following:

- a short research proposal/statement of no more than 250 words.
- a running list of the keywords and subject headings you are using to search for sources.
- an `annotated bibliography` of all the sources used to construct your research project. 
    - *Use [permalinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink) to link your sources to their location online in the library system*.
- a current draft of your research essay.
- a weekly reflective "blog" post about the progress of your research project (see below).

{{< hint note >}}
<span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-star-of-life"></i></span> I have created a [model author page](/courses/writing-3/author-page) here that you may use as a template.
{{< /hint >}}

### 5. End-of-Week Reflection

Compose a weekly reflective "blog" post on your [Author Page](/courses/writing-3/wr3-syllabus/#4-author-page) that details your efforts that week to further your research project. At first these posts will likely be searching, inarticulate musings as you fumble through possible ideas for a research project. However, as your research intensifies and comes into sharper focus, these posts should begin to include the specific steps that you took that week to further the project in some way. What kind of research problems or difficulties did you encounter? What sources did you locate? How is the project evolving as you read and think more deeply on your subject? In essence, I would like you to blog your experiences as a novice researcher engaged in your first big research project. Significantly: the things you say in your posts will help me, the tutor, and your colleagues as we try to assist you with your project.

## Students With Disabilities

Students requesting disability-related accommodations and services for this course are required to register with Student Accessibility Services (SAS; [Getting Started with SAS webpage](https://students.dartmouth.edu/student-accessibility/students/working-sas/getting-started); student.accessibility.services@dartmouth.edu; 1-603-646-9900) and to request that an accommodation email be sent to me in advance of the need for an accommodation. Then, students should schedule a follow-up meeting with me to determine relevant details such as what role SAS or its [Testing Center](https://students.dartmouth.edu/student-accessibility/services/testing-center) may play in accommodation implementation. This process works best for everyone when completed as early in the quarter as possible. If students have questions about whether they are eligible for accommodations or have concerns about the implementation of their accommodations, they should contact the SAS office. All inquiries and discussions will remain confidential.

{{< details "3 - Disaster, Apocalypse, & the State of Nature" >}}

Philosophers and social scientists have attempted to explain the origins of civilization and the rise of the modern state for centuries. A key concept in this conversation is the “state of nature,” a hypothetical condition where human beings lived without government. In this primitive state there is no law or authority, only anarchy and the pervasive threat of violence. Thinkers of the past such as Hobbes and Locke used this hypothetical condition to explain why the state of nature no longer exists and how civilized orders came to be. Today, however, many writers, filmmakers, and social scientists imagine apocalyptic scenarios of disaster wherein society regresses again to chaotic states of nature. Why do we produce such imaginings? What purpose(s) do they serve? And why have these narratives become so prominent of late?

{{< details "4 - The Apocalypse & the Other I" >}}

---

Cultural Studies scholars argue that post-apocalyptic narratives proliferate during periods of social crisis. During these moments of extreme social stress, cultures transmute fear, anxiety, or dread into popular art forms such as novels or films. Thus, by examining popular media produced during these particular historical moments we are afforded a glimpse of how a culture worked through difficult social problems, reacted to challenges to its foundational values, and related to its various “Others.” In this section we will examine two films, *The Last Man on Earth* (1964) and *I Am Legend* (2007), both adaptations of Richard Mattheson’s 1954 novel *I Am Legend*. What cultural anxieties or problems do these films articulate? What social solutions do they seem to offer? Significantly, how do the differences between these two films provide a metric for measuring the evolving concerns of America from the 1960s to today?

{{< details "6 - The Zombie, Civil Rights, & Race" >}}

---

>"[T]he true subject of the horror genre is the struggle for recognition of all that our civilization represses or oppresses."
>
>---Robin Wood


Vampires, werewolves, and Frankenstein are all monsters of European extraction; the zombie, however, was made in America. This prompts several questions: Why was the zombie born here rather than someplace else? What is it about the Americas and their history that made the figure of the zombie possible and popular? What does it say about us and our culture that we have created precisely *this* type of monster? In this section we will attempt to answer these questions by tracing the evolution of the zombie—from its origins in the slave-based plantation cultures of the Americas through modern interpretations of the figure in contemporary literature and film. Significantly, the zombie of today differs markedly from its precursors in the cinema of the 30s, 40s, and 50s. In these earlier films the zombie was a figure within an imperialist discourse that expressed racist ideologies and the anxieties of post-slavery cultures throughout the Americas. However, just as the figure of the zombie had nearly been forgotten, a new form of the creature appeared in 1968 in George Romero’s *Night of the Living Dead*. No longer was the zombie a folkloric figure born of the struggle between master and slave; now it was a cannibalistic creature that stalked the countryside in swarms, mindlessly searching for human flesh. How do we account for this sudden transformation of the zombie? What cultural “work” did the zombie perform?

{{< details "7 - Slow Violence, Eco-pocalypse, and Poverty"  >}}

---

We tend to think of violence as an explosive event that erupts in a singular moment in time and space; however, scholar Rob Nixon argues that we must sensitize ourselves to what he calls “slow violence," a form of violence “that occurs gradually and out of sight, a violence of delayed destruction that is dispersed across time and space, an attritional violence that is typically not viewed as violence at all” (2). In particular, Nixon’s focus in his influential work *Slow Violence* is on climate disaster: the slow-moving catastrophes of global warming, poisoned groundwater, toxic waste, chemical exposure, deforestation, and species extinction. These catastrophes, Nixon argues, are difficult to apprehend or represent in narrative form because they take place over years, decades, lifetimes, generations; as “spectacle deficient” events, they struggle for representation in a media environment that is biased toward more sensational forms of violence. Yet, these forms of ecocide are forms of violence surely, ones that remain invisible to many of us because they principally affect the impoverished and forgotten global poor. How can we recalibrate our perceptions to recognize these forms of slow violence? How do we convert “slow violence” into narrative form so that we can communicate its dangers, raise public awareness, and mobilize efforts for change?

{{< details "7 - Apocalyptic Masculinities" >}}

---

Recent post-apocalyptic narratives depict cults of hypermasculinity that redress the “malaise” of the modern male—cowed by feminism, political correctness, and the social sanctions against putative masculine traits of competition, aggression, sexuality, and violence, the modern man experiences an unsustainable (and potentially explosive) repression of his animal nature. These narratives revel in neo-primativist fantasies of male empowerment based in dominance, gun culture, adventure, and the subordination and control of others, particularly women. Many of these films express an incipient or perhaps secret desire to totally destroy modern civilization, which is seen as enervating and effeminate. David Fincher's 1999 film *Fight Club* might be considered a symptomatic text in many ways. In its representation of the emasculated office cubicle drone we see a pointed critique of consumerism linked to a nostalgic desire to return to nature and the hard masculinity of the past. However, the the film's critique of capitalism and masculinity is complex and multilayered, perhaps even schizophrenic.

{{< details "8 - TEOTWAWKI: Prepping for the End" >}}

---

Recent years have seen an explosion of “reality” television programming based in survival skills or challenges. Popular shows in this regard include game shows like *Survivor* and adventure shows like *Man vs. Wild* and *Survivorman*. Newer programming includes the Discovery Channel’s *Dude, You’re Screwed*, *Alaska Bush People*, *Dual Survival*, and the rather prurient *Naked and Afraid*. While these shows give viewers the vicarious thrill of braving the wilderness from the comfort of their armchairs, there has recently been an explosion in survivalist subcultures, known collectively as “prepping.” Preppers build bomb shelters and other fortifications where they stockpile food, supplies, firearms, and ammunition in preparation for TEOTWAWKI: The end of the world as we know it. A number of "reality" television shows have emerged in response to these cultural phenomena: *Doomsday Preppers*, *Doomsday Castle*, and *Doomsday Bunker*. The list of prepper fears is long: generalized civil unrest, total social collapse, global weather catastrophes, the return of Christ, peak oil, attacks using EMPs, solar flares, and, of course, zombies. Are these views largely fueled by paranoia or a desire for self-reliance? Do these fears and anxieties signify some larger, unarticulated criticism or anxiety about modernity or capitalism?

{{< details "9 - Drafting, Revising, Presenting" >}}

---

This week is dedicated to our presentations. Each of you will make a short presentation around 5 minutes in length. Your presentation may take any form you like, but consider your audience. Your fellow classmates have not read your essay or researched your topic. How can you help them understand your ideas and arguments? What context will they need to know? What terms or historical details do you need to unpack? Make sure to practice and time your talk so that you don't go over the allotted time. Feel free to use a visual aid, such as PowerPoint slides or handouts.  

- *Each of you should be prepared to present on Monday*. I will have my son Hayden randomly number you to avoid any appearance of favoritism. He will get to practice his numbers as a result!
