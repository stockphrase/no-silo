# Disaster, Apocalypse, and the State of Nature

# Reading Notes


## Thomas Hobbes, *Leviathan* (1651)


- Men are essentially equal when all is “reckoned together.” Equal in power, equal in common sense or wisdom. We might think that we are smarter than others, but we are mostly the same. 

This sense of equality leads to three causes of "quarrel":

- `COMPETITION`: Because we know ourselves to be equals, we become hopeful of attaining ends, goals, possessions. However, this puts us at odds with others; when two people want the same thing, they become enemies. As a result, they attempt to “subdue” or “destroy” each other. Sometimes this is just for self-preservation; sometimes it is just out of pleasure. Thus, if you grow crops, or have a house, or money, and you are alone, without protection, someone will come and take it from you. And this invader is likewise vulnerable to someone else--perhaps someone bigger, stronger, or perhaps a bunch of people who might come to kill you and take your stuff. 


- ``DIFFIDENCE``: We desire security, the “conservation” of our lives and what we need to live. This is living within the “modest bounds” of human life. In this case, we “master” only those who seek to take our lives or the things we need to live. However, there are others who are not so modest, who desire power, control over others, dominance, “conquest.” Therefore, this compels even the “modest” person to engage in the conquest of others; merely trying to defend oneself is a losing proposition. The logic of this situation demands that I take what other’s have before they take everything from me.

- ``GLORY``: Without an authority that keeps humans in “awe” with it’s power, we seek to elevate ourselves over each other for reputation.
    

-   **Key summary about Hobbes’ view on the *nature* of mankind**: “So
    that in the nature of man, we find three principles of quarrel.
    First, competition; secondly, diffidence; thirdly, glory. The first
    maketh men invade for gain; the second, for safety; and the third,
    for reputation. The first use violence, to make themselves masters
    of other men’s persons, wives, children, and cattle; the second, to
    defend them; the third, for trifles, as a word, a smile, a different
    opinion, and any other sign of undervalue, either direct in their
    persons or by reflection in their kindred, their friends, their
    nation, their profession, their name”.

-   **War is a “tract of time”**: War isn’t just moments of battle; war
    is “a tract of time, wherein the will to contend by battle is
    sufficiently known.” By this, I believe, Hobbes means that when we
    all know we are experiencing a time of war, that knowledge has
    consequences and introduces a new dynamic to our thinking. For example, when I
    encounter a stranger, the logic of war demands that I kill first and
    ask questions later: *I know that you know; you know that I know;
    and I know that you know that I know that this is war*. When we find
    ourselves in this situation, the most logical reaction is to kill
    everyone you encounter and take all that you see because everyone
    else will do the same. And even if they wouldn’t, we must act as if
    they would. Thus, even a reasonable and nonviolent person is
    forced into a stance of violence. And this has further consequences. Our behavior doesn't just 
    change when we are engaged in battles. This war is like weather, a "tract of time" when
    a battle may occur at any moment unexpectedly. Thus, when we know we are in this time of war,
    there is no: 1) economy, 2) no planting or harvesting of food, 3) no
    transportation of goods, 4) no exploration, 5) no arts, or books, or
    culture. What exists is “continual fear, and danger of violent
    death; and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and
    short.”

-   **The State of Nature is amoral**: there is no good or evil, no
    notion of right or wrong, there is just a basic, violent, struggle
    of survival. There is no “mine” and "thine," no property: just
    what we have as long as we can keep it.

## Curtis, *Post-Apocalyptic Fiction and the Social Contract*

-   The book is about **social contract theory**, the **state of
    nature**, and postapocalyptic fiction. *The main thesis is that this
    fiction is about our desire to “start over”* (2).

-   This fiction describes a surviving remnant of humanity within the
    blank slate of the *state of nature*. As such, it foregrounds human
    motivations, human nature, the different ways that we “seek to live
    together” and the conflict between those two visions.

-   This fiction imaginatively considers the “conditions under which we
    would like to live” (2).

-   Curtis notes that this form of fiction has completely “suffused the
    popular culture” (3). I wonder: what does that say about our views
    on the civilization we’ve built?

-   Curtis argues that Social Contract Theory is always “backward”
    looking: it attempts to justify the present civilization and state
    of affairs. In that sense, it is a conservative exercise or theory.
    However, postapocalyptic fiction is “forward looking” in that it
    imagines what *could* be. Thus, it is potentially “utopian” in nature.
    While Curtis doesn’t say this, we might just say that it is a
    revolutionary act.

-   ​(4) Social Contract Theory is dry; Post-apocalyptic fiction
    dramatizes the theory, helps us imagine it, makes it more powerful.
    The Post-apocalyptic fiction is *cathartic*, in that by seeing the
    fictional destruction we are purged of our fears or “awakened” to
    the need to prevent it. Post-apocalyptic fiction provides a “useful
    fiction” that we may use to “come together and renegotiate our
    lives”: How do we want to live? (6).

-   **Great quote here about the multiple purposes of Post-apocalyptic fiction**. It destroys all systems of order. All hierarchies, all
    laws and systems, all constraints about sexuality and gender, and
    morality. We can built the world again. They provide an opportunity
    to examine our civilization, our nations, our cultures and evaluate
    them. Again, this is a radical, revolutionary act to imagine the
    destruction of the current order (6-7).

-   There are dystopian fictions where there is no starting over (like
    in *The Road*), and utopian fictions where we start over again (7)

-   PAF allows us to ask: “what do we fear, what do we desire, how do we
    plan to allay those fears and realize those desires”? (7).

-   **Narrative structure of PAF**: 1) White man is the hero —\>
    DESTRUCTION —\> He finds a companion —\> They encounter “the other”
    —\> THREAT —\> Form larger community —\> Connect with other
    communities —\> Defeat Others.

-   (10). **Purpose of State of Nature theory is to argue against the
    idea that government is natural (like divine right of kings)**.
    Instead, it is a construct, something made by mankind. Thus, it can
    be revised, altered. Allows us to imagine what kind of world or
    government we would want to have in place of the existing one. PAF
    makes that much more dramatic and personal.

-   She mentions John Rawls’ idea of the “Original Position” from his
    *Theory of Justice* (1973).



## Mathias Nilges, “The Aesthetics of Destruction”

-   Representations of destruction are narratives, stories that cultures
    attempt to explain “the relationship between our existence and the
    external world” (23).

-   The *particular form that the destruction takes* is historically
    determined; thus we need to study that particular history if we are
    to understand the form it gave rise to (and understand why we find
    it appealing or beautiful).

-   **Important quote**: “The first step in such an analysis is to
    suggest that representations of destruction grow in number and
    popularity especially in times of (national) political, moral, and
    psychological uncertainty. Thus, we must analyze the beauty of such
    representations in relation to the specific fears, anxieties, and
    desires a historical period produces—psychological reactions that
    directly affect cultural form and our understanding of beauty” (23).

-   **Thesis Questions**: Nilges argues that there has been a large
    increase in the production of “(post)apocalyptic” narrative. If we
    examine them in the historical context of the War on Terror, what
    can we learn? What do these narratives reveal about our
    psychological condition?

-   He argues that these representations of destruction are "a
    popular way of working through or at least highlighting
    psychological contradictions produced by moments of severe crisis"
    (24). For example, we feared nuclear destruction or “body snatchers”
    during the Cold War. But now, in the post-9/11 world we see a return
    of the destruction narrative that focuses on things like terrorism. I’m
    thinking about shows like *24*, *Homeland*, etc.

-   **Solutions to problems and anxiety**: Examining the beauty in these
    depictions of destruction helps us move beyond a mere description of
    our fears; it helps us analyze and understand “how these fears are
    being resolved ideologically, sociopolitically and, ultimately,
    culturally” (24). These representations of destruction function
    “primarily as a solution to the problems posed by a complex and
    anxiety-inducing present”(24).

-   **Destruction is now viewed as antidote**: Nilges argues that,
    unlike the Cold war films, when the fear was the nuclear bombs would
    *destroy a world we loved*, today we find the destruction beautiful
    because we see it as “an antidote to the world that produces the
    fears we seek to escape” (24). **Translation**: our views of what
    is beautiful are historically contingent---they change over time and
    are unique to particular cultures. Today, we find absolute
    destruction of the world beautiful because we secretly wish to leave
    our world. Since we fear it, we wish it destroyed so we can be free
    of it.

-   He gives examples of *I am Legend* and *The Day After Tomorrow*
    where the destruction is “retroactively endowed with beauty” because
    it makes possible a new world that is “more enjoyable than our
    present” (24-5).

-   **This leads us to the historical question: what is it about today’s world that we fear or don’t like?**

    ​1 **Globalization**: After 9/11 we want to isolate ourselves;
    however, our economy is so entwined with the rest of the world that
    this is impossible.

    ​2 **Global Identity**: We have become post-national in our
    identities, favoring a “citizen of the world” model of identity.
    However, this “stateless” identity is precisely the identity assumed
    by terrorists, who are stateless actors who have no national home.

    As a result, we fear that we are fighting our own “dark double”
    (28-9). As a result, Nilges argues, that our cinema and literature
    depict our fights against terror as losing battles. For example,
    Jack Bauer in *24* might catch one terrorist, but the next “day” a
    new terrorist plot spawns again, which he will have to battle. It is
    never ending.

    3 **Crisis of the white male**. Heroic, white male characters from
    the 80s, like *Die Hard*’s John McClane, are useless against new
    threats, like cyber warfare. In the past they could save the world;
    but it today’s world their old bag of tricks don’t work. They appear
    impotent.

    ​4 **Rejection of social revision and pluralism**: Nilges argues
    that current cinema narratives reject any progressive or radical
    suggestions about pluralism, and the acceptance of others into the
    human family. Instead, there is a conservatism that harkens back
    to more traditional arrangements. (*I Am Legend* is used as an
    example).

-   **Dread vs. Anxiety**. He argues that anxiety stems from a future
    that is not defined, where there is great doubt and uncertainty.
    Dread, on the other hand, is when you contemplate something that you
    know for certain will happen. Our current era is one of anxiety. The
    representation or narrative of destruction represents a desire to
    escape the anxiety of our time and return nostalgically to a past,
    when thing were more defined and certain (29-30).

-   **Return to Paternalism**. The age of terrorism produces a crisis of
    masculinity which creates a nostalgic desire to return to a more
    paternalistic and conservative social structure.

-   **Hypermasculinity**: This also promotes a kind of
    “hypermasculinity” which perhaps might relate to things like
    “prepping,” survivalists, increased gun ownership, spectacles of
    violence, etc. Returns to nature, like in *Survivor*, etc.
