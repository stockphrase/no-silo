<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> 1) [List arguments]: Identify each argument made in the reading. Leave nothing out. Number the arguments sequentially. Write a series of numbered statements that summarize each argument.</p>

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> 2). [Summary]: Write a tight summary of the entire argument; use the list of arguments as your guide. Don’t leave out, or add, anything. </p>

3). **Quick response**. What part(s) of this did you like? Something that you appreciated? Did it inspire some thought about something? Make you curious about something? Pick something particular. 

4). Quick argument. Find a particular argument within the essay and make an argument of your own about it. Is the writer wrong about something? Could this idea be applied to something else that the author doesn't mention? Should we do something concrete or change something based on the argument? 

5). Close readings. A certain passage has a certain meaning because the author arranged a series of words together in such a way as to produce that meaning. However, another reader may interpret the words as having a very different meaning. A ‘close reading’ is a detailed explanation of what a passage means using only the words in the passage as evidence. What does this passage mean? And how did you come to have that thought? What is the evidence in the text that supports your view of what the passage means?

6). Paraphrase. Say the same thing the author says in about the same length with your own words and sentence structure. Think of this as a translation from English into English.

7). Comparison. Sketch out the ways two texts seem to be in conversation with each other on some issue, problem, or argument. Are they talking about the same issue but using different vocabulary or rhetorical strategies? Do they seem to differ on key areas of this shared concern? 

8). Critical thinking. Let’s think carefully about the argument of this text. Is it convincing? Are there weaknesses in the reasoning or evidence? Are there things that are omitted? Blind spots of some sort?

9). Key passages. What are the key moments in the text? These will no doubt include moments where key arguments are made; however, it may also just include certain terms, turns of phrase, or memorable language that seems to invite quotation in our own writing. 

10). Rhetorical analysis. Examine how the author chose to present their ideas, knowing that she could have chosen differently. Were these choices effective for for you as a reader? For a broader audience? 

11). The Big idea. Write down a ‘big idea’ that you had today in class. This could be something someone said, an idea from a reading, or something you thought. This might be useful later, so memorialize it.
