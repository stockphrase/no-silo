## Changes of Mind

In our first course reading by Nicholson Baker, we encountered an inquiry into an everyday human phenomenon: the changing of our minds. Since changes of mind are such common and universal human experiences, we tend to write them off as easily explicable events that do not invite or merit critical analysis, skepticism, or wonder. However, Baker's analysis utterly defamiliarizes these tiny mental revisions, revealing that beneath this ordinary and seemingly banal experience lies something unexpected, strange, unsettling, and complex. While it is not the explicit focus of his piece, Baker's argument exposes how our habitual experience often produces a false sense of certainty that actively prevents us from discovery. In an odd way, our positive knowledge, our understanding, our experience, may become a kind of handicap that prevents us from seeing with clarity.

Baker's knack of finding the odd in the familiar is a good model of the analytic skills that we want you to develop in this writing course and beyond. When we unthinkingly utter buzzwords like "critical thinking," this is certainly part of what we mean to suggest. We are developing a capacity to momentarily set aside the conceptual shortcuts and cognitive categories that our brains use to quickly assign meaning so that they do not interfere with our attempts to notice and understand. While our views are always partial and conditioned by powerful social forces that are difficult to escape, it is possible to train ourselves to approach the world with what [James Clerk Maxwell](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12124-020-09538-z) called a "thoroughly conscious ignorance."

In this assignment we will attempt a form of a deep textual analysis of one of a passage from Baker's text, a practice we often refer to as ``close reading.`` A close reading is an effort to explain to your audience what a passage means *using only the words in the text as evidence*. 

{{< details "What is Close Reading?" >}}

A passage means what it says because the author arranged a series of words together in such a way as to produce that meaning. However, once the writing is complete and the text is out in the world, it becomes subject to interpretation by audiences. We sometimes call these interpretations "readings." A "close reading" is a decoding exercise, a detailed explanation of exactly what a passage means (according to us) <b>using only the words in the text</b> as evidence. What do you think this passage from the text means? What evidence in the text supports your view? How far can you take the analysis? You might discover a deeper interpretation if you look up certain words in the dictionary and find less common senses of the word. You might notice the way a metaphor suggests a certain perspective on the passage or how it connects to some other theme or idea in the broader text. Write an explanation of all this thinking to your audience. A close reading should not be impressionistic (‘This writing sucks!’ or ‘I love it!’); or evaluative (‘This idea is important’); instead, it should focus on simply explaining to your audience what the passage means by meticulously pointing to how the text is constructed.

The passage you chooose should present an interpretive difficulty or be "problematic" in the sense that the meaning is a challenge to decode. What do you think this passage means? And how can you defend your interpretation of the passage using the words of the text as your only evidence?
