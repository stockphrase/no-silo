Formal education is one of the central features of our lives---a deep, organizing structure that has shaped and influenced us in profound and unaccountable ways. Education, like culture more broadly, is so ordinary and pervasive that it has become thoroughly naturalized, its powerful influence rendered virtually invisible to us. Education, in short, is just something that we've always done, something that has always been with us, something that is self-evidently the right and obvious thing to do---part of the everyday backdrop of life that we take for granted and rarely consider critically. 

Although it is quite difficult to escape the naturalizing trance that comes from our habitual exposure to such common features of our lifeworld, it is important to develop a capacity for this form of analysis---to see more clearly the weird within the familiar. Let's attempt to do something like this now: take a step outside of your own experience of formal education and try to gain some distance on the practices and normalizing structures that have been such a large part of your life since before you can even remember. Try to set aside all you know. Defamiliarize these experiences: hold them at a distance and try to look at them with a fresh perspective, as if for the first time. What do you see? This will require some effort: it is quite difficult to step outside of the automaticity that we fall into when we confront something that we think know well. Our knowledge and familiarity and comfort with a thing often blinds us to new insights about it; in an odd sense, our knowledge can be a handicap.

---

It might be helpful to begin your thinking by adopting the objective, cold analysis of some alien sociologist from outer space who has traveled many light-years to study the ways of humans. 

After cultivating this perspective, ask yourself: Are the purposes of education we commonly cite (perhaps even the ones you argued for in your first draft) actually reflected in how we construct systems of education? If not, what values does education truly seem to promote when we look at it in this new light? Does education as we have known it have some occulted or clandestine goals or purposes? Are there things that seem odd or counterproductive or wrong in how we go about education? Why do we do the things we do? Why have we built the educational institutions that we have? Are these "educational" experiences and structures actually promoting what we claim they do?

---

- Write a `response` to your first draft at the conclusion of your current one exploring these (or related) questions. 

- To help you in this work, gather the syllabi from your other two courses and closely examine these textual artifacts, like an archaeologist unearthing a shard of pottery in the desert. What do you make of these things? Since you are entering the new (and strange) culture of higher education, these textual artifacts may help you understand the values, ideas, preconceptions, and preoccupations that have authority there. 

- Your final draft should be about 1,500 words in length.

{{< details "Topic Sentences and Unified Paragraphs" >}}

#

## Topic Sentences 

`Topic sentences` function like a miniature `thesis` that communicates the purpose or main idea of a paragraph. It is important that your topic sentences are clear and accurately reflect the nature of the paragraph it initiates.

Most commonly, topic sentences are strong, declarative statements that make a `claim`. The sentences that follow the topic sentence in the paragraph are used to support that claim. However, a topic sentence may also be a question. In this case, the sentences that follow the topic sentence are used to move toward a conclusion or further develop the question.

### <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Some generally good advice about topic sentences:

1. Use the topic sentence of each paragraph to clearly state the subject or focus of the paragraph. If the paragraph and topic sentence are not in sync, or if the topic sentence doesn't actually state the nature of the paragraph, you need to revise it.

2. Use the topic sentence to set forth a `claim` that supports the thesis and drives the argument forward. This is not a hard rule, and there are other ways to start a paragraph, but it is a strong way that helps keep you focused.

Compare:

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> My high school has a unique program that allowed students to experiment and explore. 

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> Education facilitates inquiry and exploration, which are critical needs in the life of every human being.

More information on topic sentences, including examples, here in the [*Open Handbook*](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-7).

## Paragraphs 

### <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Some generally good advice about paragraphs:

Paragraphs should be *unified*: every sentence in the paragraph should focus in some way on the main idea expressed in the `topic sentence`. Further, the paragraph’s individual sentences should be presented in a logical order and flow naturally from one to the other. While this is not a strict rule, it may be helpful to think of paragraphs as miniature essays, each with their own thesis, development, and proof.

{{< details "Everyday vs. Every day" >}}
#

In the first draft I saw many students who were confused about **everyday** (as one word) and **every day** (as two words). They are very different in their meanings:


- <span style="color: var(--circle-dots)"><i class="far fa-dot-circle"></i></span> **everyday**: *adj*. As one word you use it to mean that something is *ordinary* or *common*. In fact, just substitute one of those words in place of everyday to see if the sentence still makes sense. 

- <span style="color: var(--circle-dots)"><i class="far fa-dot-circle"></i></span> **every day** *adv*. As two words it is an adverbial phrase that means "each day" or "daily," a reference to the frequency of a certain action.


---

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> My son eats oatmeal everyday. 

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> My son eats oatmeal every day.


---

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> The everyday struggles of many Americans are truly heartbreaking.

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> The every day struggles of many Americans are truly heartbreaking.

## The <i class="fas fa-bomb"></i> F-bomb solution™

For no particular reason I have discovered that if you can put an f-bomb between **every** and **day** then it should be *two words*:

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span>  I go to the store every [f*ing] day. 

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> These are my every [f*ing] day pants.

A clever way to remember this:

+ Every <i class="fas fa-bomb"></i> day (See the space? An F-bomb fits in there. Two words.)

+ Everyday (No space for the bomb. One word.)

{{< details "Comma Splices and Semicolons" >}}
#

### Semicolons

**A. Used to separate a series of items containing commas.** (Not very common).

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> I went to London, England, Paris, France, Bristol, Tennessee, and Berlin, Germany. 

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> I went to London, England; Paris, France; Bristol, Tennessee; and Berlin, Germany. 

**B.  Used to link two independent clauses to suggest a connection.** (Very common).

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> My son had trouble sleeping last night; I shouldn't have given him that chocolate cupcake.

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> Americans say they appreciate the hard work of teachers; however, very few are willing to pay them a decent wage. 

**C.  Things you don't do with semicolons**.

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> Please get three things from the store; bread, milk, and a *lot* of beer.

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> Please get three things from the store: bread, milk, and a *lot* of beer.  

### Comma splice errors

A comma splice error occurs when you use a comma to connect two independent clauses: 

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> I love my red truck, it is a Chevy Colorado. 

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> I love my red truck. It is a Chevy Colorado. 

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> I love my red truck; it is a Chevy Colorado.

{{< details "The Em Dash — " >}}

#

The **em dash** is perhaps the most versatile punctuation mark: it can function like a comma, colon, or parentheses. In formal writing it is used to indicate extra information or an aside---much as you would do with commas, colons, or parentheses. There is a good explainer on this punctuation mark on the [Merriam-Webster site](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/em-dash-en-dash-how-to-use). The two most common uses in formal writing are displayed here:

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> The Soviets gave us the greatest exercise tool ever invented - the kettlebell. 
- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> The Soviets gave us the greatest exercise tool ever invented—the kettlebell. 

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> The Soviet-Afghan War---a main contributor to the fall of the Soviet Union---has received increased scrutiny by scholars as America's mission there has foundered.

How do you show emphasis in formal writing?

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> Unless I am being unusually calculating, I don't DECIDE to befriend someone . . . 

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> Unless I am being unusually calculating, I don't **decide** to befriend someone . . .

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> Unless I am being unusually calculating, I don't *decide* to befriend someone . . .

{{< details "The 5 Paragraph Essay" >}}

#

Everyone was taught the 5-paragraph essay form in high school. There is an introduction with a thesis, three paragraphs of support, and a summary conclusion that restates the thesis. 

The problem is that you can't really do much in 5-paragraphs and your time at Dartmouth will require you to reach for rhetorical forms that can accommodate much more complexity. One place to begin is to imagine that your paper is as many paragraphs as needed in order to justify the thesis. There is no magic number of paragraphs. There is no recipe or formula. 

Another thing to reconsider is the `summary conclusion` that is a hallmark of the 5-paragraph essay. I saw many of these. You say what you've just said again at the end. Strong readers might find this somewhat insulting since it assumes we can't understand what we just read or hold these ideas in our heads for 5 paragraphs. 

If we imagine that the reader has a good grasp on what you've just argued, how should your piece end? What do you need to say or do or explain to achieve closure? What do you hope the reader takes away from your argument? What should they do in response to it?
