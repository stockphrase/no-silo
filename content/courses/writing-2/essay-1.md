## Changes of Mind

In our first course reading by Nicholson Baker, we encountered an inquiry into an everyday human phenomenon: the changing of our minds. Since changes of mind are such common and universal human experiences, we tend to write them off as easily explicable events that do not invite or merit critical analysis, skepticism, or wonder. However, Baker's analysis utterly defamiliarizes these tiny mental revisions, revealing that beneath this ordinary and seemingly banal experience lies something unexpected, strange, unsettling, and complex. While it is not the explicit focus of his piece, Baker's argument exposes how our habitual experience often produces a false sense of certainty that actively prevents us from discovery. In an odd way, our positive knowledge, our understanding, our experience, may become a kind of handicap that prevents us from seeing with clarity.

Baker's knack of finding the odd in the familiar is a good model for the analytical skills that we want you to develop in this writing course and beyond. When we utter buzzwords like "critical thinking," this is certainly part of what we mean to suggest. We are developing a capacity to momentarily set aside the conceptual shortcuts and cognitive categories that our brains use to quickly assign meaning to our experiences so that these schema do not obscure our attempts to notice and understand. While our views are always partial and conditioned by powerful social forces that are difficult to escape, it is possible to train ourselves to approach the world with fewer preconceptions, with what [James Clerk Maxwell](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12124-020-09538-z) called a "thoroughly conscious ignorance." 

During the term I would like you to keep on the lookout for passages in our course readings that seem difficult to square with your understanding of education—moments in the text that make you pause and rethink what you formerly believed to be true. These passages should present an interpretive difficulty or be "problematic" in the sense that their meaning is a challenge to decode; however, they should also present a difficulty for you in the sense that their properly decoded meaning represents a challenge to your prior views on education, especially as you described them in your first draft. How does the passage unsettle your belief or cause you to see something new about your experience of education? What do you understand the passage to mean and what does the passage mean for your understanding?

Your revised essay should perform a deep textual analysis of one of these passages, a practice we often refer to as ``close reading.`` A close reading is an effort to explain to your audience what a passage means *using only the words in the text as evidence*. If you've never heard of this term before, don't worry. We'll gain practice in close reading during our term together, in class and in our [field notebooks](/resources/project-grain-elevator/field-notes/). 

While I suppose it is possible that no passage in our reading presents you with a moment's doubt or uncertainty, it is highly improbable. It is far more likely that our readings and your analysis of your chosen passage will serve to fundamentally challenge or problematize your earlier thinking, requiring a radical reworking of your original ideas. Thus, your final draft will be a unique, perhaps utterly incommensurable, argument that emerges or becomes necessary as a result of the discoveries you make during the close reading. In short, the revision should register how you've changed your mind on the topic based on new evidence. Your two essay drafts will essentially become artifacts memorializing the transformation of your thinking—a way of measuring the distance you've traveled between your earlier idea and the change of mind you've experienced. 

Your last draft is due on our final class meeting. The subject of discussion that day will be the intellectual journey these two drafts signify.

## Revising with Close Readings

This short essay will be revised at several points during the term. After we complete each of our course readings, I ask that you revise your initial argument by performing a [close reading](/resources/project-grain-elevator/thought-machines/). Don't worry if you've never heard the term `close reading` before; we will practice this form of deep textual analysis in the coming weeks using our [field notebooks](/resources/project-grain-elevator/field-notes/). 

Each revision will begin by choosing a passage from the new reading that speaks in some way to the thinking present in your previous draft. While it is possible that the passage may be used to augment and support your initial claims about education, it is *far* more likely that your analysis of the passage will serve to fundamentally challenge or problematize your earlier thinking, requiring a radical reworking of your ideas. Thus, each draft will be a unique, perhaps utterly incommensurable, argument that emerges or becomes necessary as a result of the discoveries you make during the close reading. In short, each revision should register how you've changed your mind on the topic based on new evidence; your essay drafts will essentially become artifacts memorializing the transformations of your thinking. 

An important requirement for these revisions is that *the main claim or stance you took as your focus in the first draft should be preserved in the subsequent one*, ensuring that there is a thread connecting each version of the essay throughout the course. For example, if you first argued that the purpose of education is to help us learn important skills, then the subsequent essay should also take that idea as its starting point. You might find yourself writing: "Before I thought the purpose of education was X, but an implication of Y's argument makes me see that the purpose of education is actually Z." As a result, in each new draft your future self may end up arguing vociferously against your past self's thinking because of the new evidence you've discovered through the close reading.

Your last draft is due on our final class meeting. The subject of discussion that day will be the intellectual journey these drafts signify.

Sigh...

Formal education is one of the central features of our lives---a deep, organizing structure that has shaped and influenced us in profound and unaccountable ways. Education, like culture more broadly, is so ordinary and pervasive that it has become thoroughly naturalized, its powerful influence rendered virtually invisible to us. Education, in short, is just something that we've always done, something that has always been with us, something that is self-evidently the right and obvious thing to do---part of the everyday backdrop of life that we take for granted and rarely consider critically. 

Although it is quite difficult to escape the naturalizing trance that comes from our habitual exposure to such common features of our lifeworld, it is important to develop a capacity for this form of analysis---to see more clearly the weird within the familiar. Let's attempt to do something like this now: take a step outside of your own experience of formal education and try to gain some distance on the practices and normalizing structures that have been such a large part of your life since before you can even remember. Try to set aside all you know. Defamiliarize these experiences: hold them at a distance and try to look at them with a fresh perspective, as if for the first time. What do you see? This will require some effort: it is quite difficult to step outside of the automaticity that we fall into when we confront something that we think know well. Our knowledge and familiarity and comfort with a thing often blinds us to new insights about it; in an odd sense, our knowledge can be a handicap.

#### <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fa-brands fa-reddit-alien"></i> Alien Ethnography</span></p>

---

It might be helpful to begin your thinking by adopting the objective, cold analysis of some alien sociologist from outer space who has traveled many light-years to study the ways of humans. 

After cultivating this perspective, ask yourself: Are the purposes of education we commonly cite (perhaps even the ones you argued for in your first draft) actually reflected in how we construct systems of education? If not, what values does education truly seem to promote when we look at it in this new light? Does education as we have known it have some occulted or clandestine goals or purposes? Are there things that seem odd or counterproductive or wrong in how we go about education? Why do we do the things we do? Why have we built the educational institutions that we have? Are these "educational" experiences and structures actually promoting what we claim they do?

---

- Write a `response` to your first draft at the conclusion of your current one exploring these (or related) questions. 

- To help you in this work, gather the syllabi from your other two courses and closely examine these textual artifacts, like an archaeologist unearthing a shard of pottery in the desert. What do you make of these things? Since you are entering the new (and strange) culture of higher education, these textual artifacts may help you understand the values, ideas, preconceptions, and preoccupations that have authority there. 

- Your final draft should be about 1,500 words in length.

{{< details "Topic Sentences and Unified Paragraphs" >}}

#

## Topic Sentences 

`Topic sentences` function like a miniature `thesis` that communicates the purpose or main idea of a paragraph. It is important that your topic sentences are clear and accurately reflect the nature of the paragraph it initiates.

Most commonly, topic sentences are strong, declarative statements that make a `claim`. The sentences that follow the topic sentence in the paragraph are used to support that claim. However, a topic sentence may also be a question. In this case, the sentences that follow the topic sentence are used to move toward a conclusion or further develop the question.

### <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Some generally good advice about topic sentences:

1. Use the topic sentence of each paragraph to clearly state the subject or focus of the paragraph. If the paragraph and topic sentence are not in sync, or if the topic sentence doesn't actually state the nature of the paragraph, you need to revise it.

2. Use the topic sentence to set forth a `claim` that supports the thesis and drives the argument forward. This is not a hard rule, and there are other ways to start a paragraph, but it is a strong way that helps keep you focused.

Compare:

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> My high school has a unique program that allowed students to experiment and explore. 

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> Education facilitates inquiry and exploration, which are critical needs in the life of every human being.

More information on topic sentences, including examples, here in the [*Open Handbook*](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-7). 

---

## Paragraphs 

### <i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Some generally good advice about paragraphs:

Paragraphs should be *unified*: every sentence in the paragraph should focus in some way on the main idea expressed in the `topic sentence`. Further, the paragraph’s individual sentences should be presented in a logical order and flow naturally from one to the other. While this is not a strict rule, it may be helpful to think of paragraphs as miniature essays, each with their own thesis, development, and proof.

{{< details "Everyday vs. Every day" >}}
#

In the first draft I saw many students who were confused about **everyday** (as one word) and **every day** (as two words). They are very different in their meanings:


- <span style="color: var(--circle-dots)"><i class="far fa-dot-circle"></i></span> **everyday**: *adj*. As one word you use it to mean that something is *ordinary* or *common*. In fact, just substitute one of those words in place of everyday to see if the sentence still makes sense. 

- <span style="color: var(--circle-dots)"><i class="far fa-dot-circle"></i></span> **every day** *adv*. As two words it is an adverbial phrase that means "each day" or "daily," a reference to the frequency of a certain action.


---

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> My son eats oatmeal everyday. 

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> My son eats oatmeal every day.


---

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> The everyday struggles of many Americans are truly heartbreaking.

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> The every day struggles of many Americans are truly heartbreaking.

---

## The <i class="fas fa-bomb"></i> F-bomb solution™

For no particular reason I have discovered that if you can put an f-bomb between **every** and **day** then it should be *two words*:

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span>  I go to the store every [f*ing] day. 

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> These are my every [f*ing] day pants.

A clever way to remember this:

+ Every <i class="fas fa-bomb"></i> day (See the space? An F-bomb fits in there. Two words.)

+ Everyday (No space for the bomb. One word.)

{{< details "Comma Splices and Semicolons" >}}
#

### Semicolons

**A. Used to separate a series of items containing commas.** (Not very common).

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> I went to London, England, Paris, France, Bristol, Tennessee, and Berlin, Germany. 

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> I went to London, England; Paris, France; Bristol, Tennessee; and Berlin, Germany. 

**B.  Used to link two independent clauses to suggest a connection.** (Very common).

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> My son had trouble sleeping last night; I shouldn't have given him that chocolate cupcake.

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> Americans say they appreciate the hard work of teachers; however, very few are willing to pay them a decent wage. 

**C.  Things you don't do with semicolons**.

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> Please get three things from the store; bread, milk, and a *lot* of beer.

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> Please get three things from the store: bread, milk, and a *lot* of beer.  

### Comma splice errors

A comma splice error occurs when you use a comma to connect two independent clauses: 

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> I love my red truck, it is a Chevy Colorado. 

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> I love my red truck. It is a Chevy Colorado. 

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> I love my red truck; it is a Chevy Colorado.

{{< details "The Em Dash — " >}}

#

The **em dash** is perhaps the most versatile punctuation mark: it can function like a comma, colon, or parentheses. In formal writing it is used to indicate extra information or an aside---much as you would do with commas, colons, or parentheses. There is a good explainer on this punctuation mark on the [Merriam-Webster site](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/em-dash-en-dash-how-to-use). The two most common uses in formal writing are displayed here:

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> The Soviets gave us the greatest exercise tool ever invented - the kettlebell. 
- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> The Soviets gave us the greatest exercise tool ever invented—the kettlebell. 

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> The Soviet-Afghan War---a main contributor to the fall of the Soviet Union---has received increased scrutiny by scholars as America's mission there has foundered.

How do you show emphasis in formal writing?

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> Unless I am being unusually calculating, I don't DECIDE to befriend someone . . . 

- <span style="color: var(--due)"><i class="fas fa-times-circle"></i></span> Unless I am being unusually calculating, I don't **decide** to befriend someone . . .

- <span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-check-circle"></i></span> Unless I am being unusually calculating, I don't *decide* to befriend someone . . .

{{< details "The 5 Paragraph Essay" >}}

#

Everyone was taught the 5-paragraph essay form in high school. There is an introduction with a thesis, three paragraphs of support, and a summary conclusion that restates the thesis. 

The problem is that you can't really do much in 5-paragraphs and your time at Dartmouth will require you to reach for rhetorical forms that can accommodate much more complexity. One place to begin is to imagine that your paper is as many paragraphs as needed in order to justify the thesis. There is no magic number of paragraphs. There is no recipe or formula. 

Another thing to reconsider is the `summary conclusion` that is a hallmark of the 5-paragraph essay. I saw many of these. You say what you've just said again at the end. Strong readers might find this somewhat insulting since it assumes we can't understand what we just read or hold these ideas in our heads for 5 paragraphs. 

If we imagine that the reader has a good grasp on what you've just argued, how should your piece end? What do you need to say or do or explain to achieve closure? What do you hope the reader takes away from your argument? What should they do in response to it?
