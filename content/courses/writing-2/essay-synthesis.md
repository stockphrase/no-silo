# Essay 2


## Prompt

Percy and Freire, each in their own way, ask us to consider the problem of authority within systems or experiences of education. Write an essay that `synthesizes` their thinking, explaining how they both investigate the nature of this problem, examine its consequences, and offer solutions.

To begin, review your `close reading` exercises, annotations, and other field note entries for Percy and Freire's essays. Using these items as resources—and by returning to the full texts again—examine Percy and Freire's arguments for evidence of mutual interest. If we imagine that these texts are broadly in dialogue with each other, what main concerns or problems lie at the heart of these arguments? And what are the positions, arguments, ideas, and terminology that the two sources seem to share in response? Do the authors articulate identical concerns? Or do they differ in important ways? What reasoning supports their arguments? Do they offer similar conclusions or are there significant differences in their thought? And why do those differences matter? 

Throughout this essay we should hear *your* voice; it should be clear that there is a thinking mind orchestrating this deeply comparative analysis for a purpose of his/her own design. Why is all of this important? What concerns do you share with these two thinkers? What are the consequences for failing to have the right view on these problems or refusing to take the appropriate action? In short, it should be clear what *you* think in this essay.

Synthesis is very textual in nature: you must show explicit textual evidence for each of the claims you attribute to the authors. Like our `close reading` work in class, your job here is to clearly explain the ideas and arguments of these thinkers, using their words and terms as evidence. Using summary, paraphrase, and quotation, explain the two arguments to your audience, comparing and contrasting the authors’ viewpoints. Make sure to cite any reference to the text appropriately. Use clear [signal phrases](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-8/#working-with-sources) to transition between your presentations of the various author’s ideas or works.

## More on Synthesis

As the name suggests, synthesis essays focus on combining and connecting. Your focus in a synthesis essay is to explain to your audience the ways in which two or more arguments or ideas relate to one another.

Students attempting synthesis for the first time often make the mistake of organizing their essays by *source*. For example, they will introduce two authors in their introduction, summarize Author A, summarize Author B, then conclude by noting the broad similarities and differences in the two authors’ thinking. This is *not* synthesis.

In a synthesis essay you should try to organize your essay by *topic* or *questions at issue* rather than by sources. Rather than try to summarize the essays separately, a synthesis will attempt to discover the various things that the authors discuss---the questions, ideas, and arguments they have in common---then present those things in an organized and meaningful way. Thus, your objective in a synthesis is to bring two or more distinct sources into a relationship by explaining to your reader the various ways in which the sources are in dialogue.

To begin a synthesis, ask yourself the following questions about the readings you plan to synthesize:

>What are the positions, arguments, and ideas that the source materials have in common? Are the authors all concerned about the same problem(s)? Are their arguments similar or do they differ? What reasoning supports their arguments? Do they offer similar conclusions or are there significant differences?

After answering these questions exhaustively, you will be able to explain the relationship between the various authors’ arguments—comparing and contrasting their views using their words and ideas as evidence.
