## Changes of Mind

In our first course reading by Nicholson Baker, we encountered an inquiry into an everyday human phenomenon: the changing of our minds. Since changes of mind are such common and universal human experiences, we tend to write them off as easily explicable events that neither invite nor merit critical analysis, skepticism, or wonder. However, Baker's analysis utterly defamiliarizes these mental revisions, revealing that beneath this ordinary and seemingly banal experience lies something unexpected, strange, unsettling, and complex. While it is not the explicit focus of his piece, Baker's argument exposes how our habitual experience often produces a false sense of certainty that actively prevents us from discovery. In an odd way, our positive knowledge and understanding may become a kind of handicap that prevents us from seeing with clarity.

Baker's knack of finding the odd in the familiar is a good model for the analytical skills that we want you to develop in this writing course and beyond. When we utter buzzwords like "critical thinking," this is certainly part of what we mean to suggest. We are developing a capacity to momentarily set aside the conceptual shortcuts and cognitive categories that our brains use to quickly assign meaning to our experiences so that these schema do not obscure our attempts to notice and understand. While our views are always partial and conditioned by powerful social forces that are difficult to escape, it is possible to train ourselves to approach the world with fewer preconceptions—with what James Clerk Maxwell called a "thoroughly conscious ignorance." 

During the term I would like you to keep on the lookout for passages in our course readings that seem difficult to square with your understanding of education—moments in the text that make you pause and rethink what you formerly believed to be true. These passages should present an interpretive difficulty or be "problematic" in the sense that their meaning is a challenge to decode; however, they should also present a difficulty for you in the sense that their properly decoded meaning represents a challenge to your prior views on education, especially as you described them in your first draft. How does the passage unsettle your belief or cause you to see something new about your experience of education? What do you understand the passage to mean and what does the passage mean for your understanding?

Your revised essay should perform a deep textual analysis of one of these passages, a practice we often refer to as ``close reading.`` A close reading is an effort to explain to your audience what a passage means *using only the words in the text as evidence*. It is a method of *evincing* reading: like a math teacher who insists that you "show your work" as you solve a math problem, close reading is "showing the work" of reading or interpretation to your audience. If I make a claim about the text or object, I have to show what words of the text or features of the object justify my view. If you've never heard of this term before, don't worry. We'll gain practice in close reading during our term together, in class and in our [field notebooks](/resources/project-grain-elevator/field-notes/).
