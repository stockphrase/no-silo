# Fall Reflection and Review

{{< hint note >}}
This assignment takes the place of a final exam and asks you to reflect on all of your work this term. **The reflections and self-evaluations your perform here will largely determine your final grade**. Please write down your responses and keep them in a safe place---they will be used in a conference during the first week of classes this winter term. 

<span style="color: var(--in-class)"><i class="fas fa-star-of-life"></i></span> My rationale for this assignment is explained somewhat in question #6 in the [FAQ](/resources/FAQs).

{{< /hint >}}

After submitting all of your work for the term, gather together all of the drafts from the three major writing assignments of the term. (You are [saving all your work](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-4/), right?) Carefully examine the drafts for each of the main essay assignments in order, from first draft to final draft. Take time to compare the pieces and notice how they evolved due to your own process of revision and in response to the commentary you received from your professor, teaching assistant, and fellow students.

- *For each of the three essays, write down a response to the following questions*:

1. How did your essay change from first draft to final form?
2. What was particularly strong about this revised, final version?
3. What things could you still improve in this final draft? 
4. What were you particularly proud of in the final draft?
4. Considering the whole process of writing this essay, what did you learn?

{{< /hint >}}

- *Write a short response to the following questions*:

1. Thinking about your experience of the class as a whole, what have you learned?
2. Was there something you expected to learn, but didn't?
3. Are there specific things you would like to work on in the winter term?
4. What do you struggle with as a writer and student?

2. How engaged were you in the class?

5. Did you give your best effort on each assignment?
6. Expressed as a percentage, how much of the reading did you do?
7. How much did you contribute to Hive? Was this your best effort at sharing/helping others?
