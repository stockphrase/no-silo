# Fall Reflection and Review

This assignment asks you to reflect on all of your work this term. Ideally, this assignment would be completed during the calm after exams while you are at home with your families. Your responses to the questions below will be used in a conference during the first week of classes this winter.

{{< /hint >}}


## I. Review your writing

Gather together all of the drafts from the three major writing assignments of the term. (You are [saving all your work](/resources/open-handbook/chapter-4/), right?) Re-read the drafts for each of the main essay assignments in order, from first draft to final draft. Take time to compare the pieces and notice how they evolved due to your own process of revision and in response to the commentary you received from your professor and fellow students.

For each of the three essays, write down a response to the following questions:

1. How did your essay change from first draft to final form?
2. What was particularly strong about this revised, final version?
3. What things could you still improve in this final draft? 
4. What were you particularly proud of in the final draft?
4. Considering the whole process of writing this essay, what did you learn?


## II. Review your learning

1. Thinking about your experience of the class as a whole, what have you learned?
2. Was there something you expected to learn, but didn't?
3. Are there specific things you would like to work on in the winter term?
4. What is your biggest struggle as a writer and student?


## III. Review your participation

1. How many classes or TA sessions did you miss?
2. How engaged were you in the class? 
3. Did you complete all the assignments?
4. Were all the assignments turned in on time?
5. Did you give your best effort on each assignment?
6. Expressed as a percentage, how much of the reading did you do?
7. How much did you contribute to Hive? Was this your best effort at sharing/helping others?
8. How often did you contribute on discussion days? Could you have contributed more to the conversation?

## IV. Final grade

Taking into account all of these reflections and self-evaluations, what final grade would you suggest for yourself?
