<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> 1).</font> <font color="#287271">LIST ALL ARGUMENTS</font>: Identify each argument made in the reading. You might choose a certain symbol to flag arguments during your reading and textual annotations. You might use the letter A, for example. One of the main skills required here is the ability to distinguish assertions and claims (arguments) from the things that support them: examples, metaphors, and evidence. In a separate document, write down a series of numbered statements that summarize each argument that you detect in the text.


---

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> 2). <font color="">SUMMARY</font>: In a summary you present the ideas of another writer in a condensed form. The length of a summary is dictated by your rhetorical needs, but they are always <u>shorter</u> than the original text. Although a summary sacrifices specificity and detail in the interest of brevity, it must always remain a faithful representation of the original text. Write a tight summary of the entire argument; use <u>LIST ALL ARGUMENTS</u> as your guide. Don’t leave anything out. Don't add anything that isn't there. No opinions or evaluations. Just the facts.</p>

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> 3). <font color="">QUICK RESPONSE</font>: What part(s) of this essay gave you pause? Made you curious about something? Did it inspire some thinking about something? Make you curious about something? Pick something particular and explain what the esssay inspired for you personally. While the response genre will be personal in nature, it should not be without substance. For example, it isn't enough to say "I liked it" or "This was no good."</p>  

---

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> 4). <font color="">QUICK ARGUMENT</font>: Find a particular argument within the essay and make an argument of your own about it. Is the writer wrong about something? Could this idea be applied to something else that the author doesn't mention? If we think the author is right, should we do something concrete or change something in our lives based on the argument? </p>  

---

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> 5). <font color="">CLOSE READING</font>: A passage means what it says because the author arranged a series of words together in such a way as to produce that meaning. A ‘close reading’ is a detailed explanation of what a passage means using only the words in the passage as evidence. What does this passage mean? What is the evidence in the text that supports your view of what the passage means? </p>  

---

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> 6). <font color="">PARAPHRASE</font>: Say the same thing the author says in about the same length using your own words and sentence structure. Think of this as a translation from English into English. </p>  
     
---

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> 7). <font color="">COMPARISON</font>: Sketch out the ways two texts seem to be in conversation with each other on some issue, problem, or argument. Are they talking about the same issue but using different vocabulary or rhetorical strategies? Do they seem to differ on key areas of this shared concern? </p>  
     
---

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> 8). <font color="">CRITICAL THINKING</font>: Let’s think carefully about the argument of this text. Is it convincing? Are there weaknesses in the reasoning or evidence? Are there things that are omitted? Blind spots of some sort? </p>  
     
---
             
<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> 9). <font color="">KEY PASSAGES</font>: What are the key moments in the text? These will no doubt include moments where key arguments are made; however, it may also just include certain terms, turns of phrase, or memorable language that seems to invite quotation in our own writing. Imagine that you are stripping the argument for parts so that you can use them for something you are building. What are the essential, necessary items that you need to extract?</p>  
     
---

<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> 10). <font color="">RHETORICAL ANALYSIS</font>: Examine how the author chose to present their ideas, knowing that she could have chosen differently. For example, one author might write a traditional argument while another may choose to tell a story. A write might be furious, mocking, sarcastic; or, they may take the "high road" and try to win the audience with a high-minded and respectful form of discourse.  Were these choices effective for for you personally as a reader? What about for a broader audience?</p>  
     
---
   
<p style="font-family:TrixieHDOT-Heavy"> 11). <font color="">THE BIG IDEA</font>: Write down a ‘big idea’ that you had today in class. This could be something someone said, an idea from a reading, or something you thought. Perhaps this idea might relate to some of your own writing in the class. Or relate to something more personal for you. This thought might be useful later, so memorialize it.</p>
