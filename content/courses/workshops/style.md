# Style and Sentence length

---

Some of the best advice on style I've ever read comes from Gary Provost's *100 Ways to Improve Your Writing.* Read this paragraph out loud to yourself and see if you can hear what Provost is getting at:

>This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. Itâ€™s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals---sounds that say listen to this, it is important.


## Workshop

In this workshop I would like you to pick a paragraph or two from some of the writing you are currently working on. Rewrite the paragraph(s) using the inspiration from Provost's idea.
