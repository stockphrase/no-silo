## Searching with Precision

This workshop is designed to help you perform `keyword searches` of library catalogs and electronic databases with efficiency. While most students have some familiarity with keyword searching through the Google search engine, library catalogs and databases don't work in the same way. To query databases effectively and efficiently, you need to be familiar with `Boolean` searches.

Keyword searches often produce too many results to examine in a reasonable amount of time. Keyword searches also suffer from large volumes of irrelevant results. Rather than page through hundreds or thousands of search results or sift through unwanted ones, you can use what are known as Boolean searches to make your searches much more precise. Boolean searches use what are known as ``logical operators`` to form search strings that help you zero in on the content you seek. 

The three most common logical operators are **AND**, **OR**, and **NOT**. However, you should also learn how to use `exact phrases`, `truncation`, and `wildcards` in search strings.

## Workshop

Study the following information, then complete the problem sets.

#

| Operator   | Purpose | Example    
|:----------|:-------------|---------|
| `AND` | Narrow a search by adding additional keywords | Tom Hardy AND shirtless
| `OR` | Broaden a search by adding additional keywords | Ohio OR Virginia
| `NOT` | Prune search results by removing certain keywords | Vikings NOT football
| `"..."` | Return results containing an exact phrase | "artificial intelligence"
| `*`     | Truncation: used to capture all the word endings from a search term    | manufact*
| `?`     | Wildcard: Finds spelling variations   | organi?ation, wom?n

### Boolean search examples

These Boolean terms are described in more detail below:

{{< details "AND" closed >}} 

#

Although it may seem counterintuitive, `AND` is used to *narrow* the
number of sources you retrieve from a database. You can visualize the
search of a large academic database or library catalog using the
following diagram:

<div style="text-align:center">{{< figure src="/img/and.png" >}}

{ linguistics `AND` cognitive `AND` childhood }</div>

In the search depicted above, a student has requested articles that
contain the subjects **cognitive**, **linguistics**, and **childhood**.
This particular search will only retrieve articles that contain *all
three terms*. This small subset of the larger subject sets is referenced
by the arrow. All the information represented by the other portions of
the three circles will be excluded. Thus, even if an article contains
two of the three search terms, it will be excluded from the results.

{{< /details >}}

{{< details "OR" closed >}} 

#

Unlike the `AND` operator, `OR` seeks to *broaden* a search, as in
this example:

<div style="text-align:center">{{< figure src="/img/or.png" >}}


{ Virginia `OR` Ohio }</div>

In the search depicted above, a student has searched for the subjects
Virginia `OR` Ohio. This search will return *every* article having the
subject of Virginia as well as *every* article with the subject of Ohio.
Unlike the `AND` search, where only articles containing *both* terms
are returned in the search results, the `OR` search yields every
source on both subjects regardless of whether those subjects appear
together in the same source. As a consequence, the `OR` search will
produce far more results.

-   Since the `OR` operator lacks precision, it is most often used in
    parenthetical searches, described below.

{{< /details >}} 

{{< details "NOT" closed >}} 

#

The Boolean operator `NOT` is used to *subtract* or *screen out*
topics or keywords that are unwanted within the search results.

<div style="text-align:center">{{< figure src="/img/not.png" >}}


{ "alternative energy" `NOT` solar }</div>

In the search depicted above, a student is researching alternative
energy and wants to exclude any information dealing with solar energy.
To remove all references to solar energy, the student has searched for
"**alternative energy**," but has removed any articles from the search
results that contain the subject **solar** using the operator `NOT`.

The `NOT` operator is helpful when you find your search results are
polluted with unwanted items. This is often a problem when two
distinct things share the same name. For example, if you were
researching the Norse explorers known as the Vikings, you might discover
that your search results include unwanted information about the
Minnesota Vikings football team. You can subtract these unwanted results
by searching for **Vikings `NOT` Minnesota** or **Vikings `NOT` football**,
for example.

This search uses quotation marks to form an `exact phrase` search, described below.

### Advanced searching

These Boolean operators can be used to create long, increasingly precise search strings when they are fortified with more advanced operators: `parentheticals`, `exact phrases`, and `wildcards`.

{{< details "Parenthetical searches" closed >}} 

You can also use the various Boolean search terms in tandem using
parenthetical constructions:

-   (Ohio OR Virginia) AND unemployment

-   (cognitive AND linguistics) NOT childhood

Such parenthetical searches follow the [order of operations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations), like in math
equations. In the first example, the search will first combine all the
articles with the keyword of **Ohio** to all the articles with the keyword **Virginia**, creating a large collection of search results. Afterward, the keyword **unemployment** will be applied to that collection using the `AND` operator, yielding the final search results that look for sources dealing with unemployment in either Virginia and Ohio. Similarly, the second example creates a large collection of results that share the subjects **cognitive** and **linguistics**, then all the items having the term **childhood** are removed from the results.

{{< details "Exact phrase searches" closed >}} 

#

Most Internet search engines and library catalogs default to the `AND`
operator when multiple terms are entered, even if it has not been typed
by the user. For example, if you search for **artificial intelligence**,
the search algorithm will actually use the search string **artificial
`AND` intelligence** to produce your results. In some circumstances this
may produce undesirable results. For example, we might
imagine an article about the "intelligence" of using certain
"artificial" sweeteners in food for children. This is not an article that is relevant for your project.

To avoid this problem, you can instruct your search engine to perform
what is known as an `exact phrase search`. This is performed by
placing quotation marks around the exact words you are searching for:

- "artificial intelligence" AND apocalypse 

By searching for "artificial intelligence" your search results will only
contain items that have that exact phrase within the document or title.


{{< /details >}} 

{{< details "Truncation and wildcards" closed >}} 

#

-   manufact\* (truncation)

-   wom?n (wild card)

If you search for the terms steel `AND` manufacturing, your search
results may not include results with the terms **manufacturer**,
**manufacture**, **manufactured**, or **manufactures**. As a result, you
may not discover articles or books that are important to your research.
By truncating the word with an asterisk, however, you will gather all the
relevant search results.

Similarly, if you only search for wom**an**, you will potentially miss out on
the all the texts that mention wom**en** or wom**y**n. Or imagine that you are doing research on a certain type of organization. It would be wise to search for **organi?ation**, since much of the English-speaking world spells the word with an "s" instead of a "z" as we do here in the US. Without this, your research may become skewed to favor the literature on US-based institutions. However, using the wild card `?` you will search all spellings simultaneously, gathering all the
relevant results. *The question mark wild card should be used to replace a single letter only*.

 

 To illustrate, look at these two searches on the JSTOR database:

- [Iraq AND manufacturing](https://www-jstor-org.dartmouth.idm.oclc.org/action/doAdvancedSearch?q0=Iraq+and+manufacturing&f0=all&c1=AND&q1=&f1=all&c2=AND&q2=&f2=all&c3=AND&q3=&f3=all&c4=AND&q4=&f4=all&c5=AND&q5=&f5=all&c6=AND&q6=&f6=all&acc=on&la=&sd=&ed=&pt=&isbn=&group=none) (14,863 results)

- [Iraq AND manufact*](https://www-jstor-org.dartmouth.idm.oclc.org/action/doAdvancedSearch?q0=Iraq+and+manufacturing&f0=all&c1=AND&q1=&f1=all&c2=AND&q2=&f2=all&c3=AND&q3=&f3=all&c4=AND&q4=&f4=all&c5=AND&q5=&f5=all&c6=AND&q6=&f6=all&acc=on&la=&sd=&ed=&pt=&isbn=&group=none) (30,868 results) üëÄÔ∏è

## Problem Sets

1. You want to examine *fictional portrayals* of Arab-Israeli conflict. Create a Boolean search string to search the library catalog with.

2. Narrow the previous search by examining only fictional portrayals involving Israelis and Palestinians available in our library.

3. Find peer-reviewed sources that examine Herman Melville's novel *Moby Dick* and the Cold War that were written between 1990 and 2000. 

4. You are curious if there is any scholarship on fictional portrayals of pandemic disease.

5. You want to know if certain governments are using the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to spy on their citizens. 

6. You are interested in female MMA fighters and want to know if there is any scholarship on this.



<!---
1. Israel* AND (Arab* OR Palestin*) AND (literature OR fiction OR film OR movie) 
2. Israel* AND Palestin* AND (literature OR novel) apply Baker/Berry filter
3. "Moby Dick" AND "Cold War"
4. pandemic AND fiction. Find: https://search.library.dartmouth.edu/permalink/01DCL_INST/16rgcn8/alma991033426335205706 Use Sub. Search.
6. religion AND contagion AND (plague OR pandemic) 
7. Wom?n AND "mixed martial arts" AND gender

The one about COVID-19 and surveillance is a problem because this term is used about looking for cases by monitoring a population. But here we are talking about the spying on a population with the disease as an excuse. Hm. `COVID-19 AND surveillance AND "national intelligence"` or "intelligence services" Or, if you know a specific country and intel service: `COVID-19 AND surveillance AND GRU AND Russia`
