# Getting Sh<sub>*</sub>t the Library Doesn't Have

A common problem in academic research is discovering that a book or
article you require for a project is checked out, missing, or not owned
by the library. Less commonly, you may find yourself in a global pandemic and be unable
to physically visit a library to borrow books. There are a number of free services available to you
when you encounter this problem.

### Borrow Direct consortium

A number of the best libraries in the world have formed a consortium
designed to share resources and expand research opportunities for the
entire academic community. As students at Dartmouth, you may
obtain borrowing privileges at any of the other participating libraries
including Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, MIT, University of Chicago, University of Pennsylvania,
Princeton, Yale, and the Center for Research Libraries. 

To see if a book is available at another library, use a service called
[Borrow Direct](http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/res-share/borrowdirect/). With
this service you may search every library in the consortium
simultaneously to see if the book you require is available at another
institution. If the book is owned by another school and is not checked
out at the time, you may request that the item be sent to our library.
These requests usually arrive in 4 working days or less. When they arrive, you will
receive an email that it is being held for you at the circulation desk. Just tell the
person behind the desk that you have a "hold" while giving them your ID. They will get
the book for you.

containing information about when the book must be returned to avoid punishing fines.

### DartDoc

If there is a book or article you would like to read that is not
available through Borrow Direct, you may request it from Dartmouth's
interlibrary loan program, known as [DartDoc](https://dartmouth.illiad.oclc.org/illiad/berry/logon.html).[^1] To request an item, visit
the DartDoc webpage, select the appropriate form (article, book, book chapter,
etc.), and send your request electronically to the office. Staff will
request your item from another library, who will ship the book to our
library through the mail. If you are requesting a book chapter or
article, the donor library will send you a .pdf free of charge to your
DartDoc account. Make sure to download the .pdf to your computer as they disappear after a period of time. 

{{< hint note >}}
- [<i class="fas fa-circle"></i>]() If you are ordering a *physical* book, DartDoc is the slowest option. Requests may take up to two weeks to be fulfilled.


- [<i class="fas fa-viruses"></i>]() Due to Covid-19, the library will be using DartDoc to give you access to books and book chapters that you need while away from campus. While I am sure that they will do the best they can, there is likely to be a longer wait for these items than if you just walked into the library and got it yourself. This puts you at something of a disadvantage, so [you will have to be crafty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zmvt7yFTtt8).

### Recall Request

If a book is owned by our library, but checked out by another patron, you have one final option: a recall request. If a book is currently on loan, its catalog entry will contain a link that you may use to request a recall of the book. After your initiate a recall, the patron who has borrowed the book will receive a notice that they must return it. 

I don't recommend using recall requests for two reasons. First, it is considered something of a researcher's *faux pas* to do so. Some researchers, angered by a recall, have been known to counter by returning the book and then *immediately recalling it right back from you*.[^2] These are the petty games Ph.Ds play, *and we play for keeps*. Secondly, the patron will have *up to two weeks* to return the book in question. That is likely far too long for you to wait. Using Borrow Direct will almost always be a quicker path to your prized tome.   


## Workshop

1. Visit [Borrow Direct](https://www.library.dartmouth.edu/borrow-renew/borrowing-requesting#borrowdirect) and familiarize yourself with the service. 
2. Create a login for [DartDoc](https://dartmouth.illiad.oclc.org/illiad/berry/illiad.dll?Action=10&Form=79) and explore the service. 
3. Order a book if you like. It's free.

[^1]: One of my biggest pet peeves about Dartmouth is our absurd need to re-brand everything to make it "Dartmouthy." Hence, "interlibrary loan"---a term comprehensible to everyone who has ever been to a library---is replaced with something completely alienating, like "Dart-Doc." It is madness. It is Dartmouth. They are the same. 

[^2]: This was (allegedly) me. But it was some time ago and I have since sought professional help for research rage.
