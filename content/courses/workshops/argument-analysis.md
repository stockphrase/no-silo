# Argument Analysis 

---

Analysis involves breaking an argument down into smaller parts so that you can understand how those parts work together to make the whole (or fail to do so). During this class we will try to train our minds to uncover the argumentative structure of all that we read. 

Relying on your annotations, critical notes, and our discussions of the text, construct an outline of the argument found in Nicholson Baker's "Changes of Mind" essay.

Your focus in this assignment is on the essay's *argumentative structure*. What is the main conclusion that Baker wants you to accept? We can call this central claim his `thesis.` What other supporting claims does he make to bolster this conclusion?

Baker is a very playful writer; there is a lot of silliness and extravagant verbal excess in the essay. This makes it challenging to distinguish argumentative claims from his examples, metaphors, illustrations, and stories. Your job is to carefully sift through the essay to isolate the arguments, then present them as an organized list of bulleted statements.
