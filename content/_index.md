No Silo is the companion site to Alan C. Taylor's courses at Dartmouth College. The site contains syllabi, course materials, workshops, the [***Open Handbook***](/resources/open-handbook), and other related bits and pieces.

The idea for this site came from a talk I gave to the faculty of the [Institute for Writing and Rhetoric](https://writing-speech.dartmouth.edu) at Dartmouth College in the winter of 2020 about tearing down information silos and creating an open-source culture among our faculty. 

*This site is under construction. Mistakes, broken links and the like should be expected*.
