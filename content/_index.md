*No Silo* is the companion site to Alan C. Taylor's writing courses at Dartmouth College. The site contains syllabi, course materials, workshops, the [*Open Handbook*](/resources/open-handbook), and other related bits and pieces.

The idea for this site came from a talk I gave to the faculty of the [Writing Program](https://writing-speech.dartmouth.edu) at Dartmouth College in 2020 about tearing down information silos and creating an open-source teaching culture among our faculty.
