I grew up on a mountain swallowed up by [kudzu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudzu) just across the river from Chattanooga, Tennessee. 

In college and graduate school I studied nineteenth-century American literature, culture, and history. I'm interested in backcountry settlements in the early republic and conflicts between Native peoples and settlers. 

I teach writing and research at Dartmouth College.

I wrote [*The Open Handbook*](/resources/open-handbook)---a free, open-source reference book that introduces students to the conventions of academic writing and research. 

I'm a mildly accomplished computer nerd. I like open-source software and culture. I'm a fan of Canonical's [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) and System 76's [Pop!_OS](https://pop.system76.com/). I'm particularly enthused by the [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) projects.

Lately I've been listening to [The National](https://americanmary.com/), [Future Islands](https://future-islands.com/), [The War on Drugs](https://www.thewarondrugs.net/), and [Aidan Knight](https://www.aidanknight.com/) a lot. 

I'm not that [Alan Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Taylor_(historian)).
