## About me

I grew up on a mountain swallowed up by [kudzu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudzu) just across the river from Chattanooga, Tennessee.  

I teach writing and research courses for first-year students at Dartmouth College's [Institute for Writing and Rhetoric](https://writing-speech.dartmouth.edu).

In college and graduate school I studied nineteenth-century American literature and history. I'm interested in backcountry settlements in the early republic and conflicts between Native peoples and settlers.  

I'm interested in open-source software and culture. I'm a fan of Canonical's [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com) and System 76's [Pop OS](https://pop.system76.com/). I'm particularly enthused by the [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and [Jrnl](https://jrnl.sh/) projects. 

Lately I've been listening to [The National](https://americanmary.com/) and [Aidan Knight](https://www.aidanknight.com/) a lot.

I follow the Boston Red Sox and the Tennessee Volunteers football team.  

I'm a mildly accomplished computer nerd. 

I have two adorable little kids who never let me get a full night's sleep but are probably the best thing that ever happened to me.
